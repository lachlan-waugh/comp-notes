Go on royal botanic gardens website, and look through the first Nations garden



### Agriculture

* Soil was terrible couldn't support the British seeds
* British weren't the first farmers, first Nations people also had agriculture



### Modem

* What food has been taking before you, for sustainability
* Groups would move around to different parts of the country, as to not deplete resources



### Fisherwomen

* Fisherwomen would tie a fishing line around their pinkie, It would fall off
* This would give them luck, and tie them to that fish



Ms Macquarie was awful



Hmm

* First Nations people began to fish, and joined the economy. This was banned
* First intendent determined if they were sick enough to get a doctor
* Not allowed to open their own kindergarten until 1970
* Only over last few years that indigenous soldiers were acknowledged
* Soldiers weren't given land after war, nor could they open bank accounts
* More kids are removed from their homes now than during the stolen generations



Wooloomooloo in test

* Bay used to be land, with xyz rivers
* Middens were mined, shells were used for their lime, for building
* Lots of fabrication about what resources were here



#### Yurong (Mrs Macquaries point)

* Lots of hawkesbury sandstone exposed
  * This was used in early construction by the European colonies
* Would've originally been sand, mudflats, and mangroves
* Barangaroo was the site of women's business



#### The Harbour

* Sydney harbour is an estuary (semi-enclosed coastal body of water with opening to the ocean)
* Seaward portion of a drowned river valley (Ria) system
* 20,000 years ago world was experiencing glacial maximum conditions, sea levels are 120m lower than today
  * Beaches were many kilometres further out
  * Most archaeological sites are underwater
* 6,500 years ago, the water levels were slightly higher than now, coastlines were slightly further in



There was no limestone, so shells were taken from the middens, cooked, and used to make quick lime

Tank stream, originally very clean water

Became almost an open sewer

The landscape changed around the aboriginals, they were still there. However, most died from introduced diseases

1802 - aboriginals still inhabited the land
