## The Natural Environment and the National Parks of the Sydney Region

### Part A: What is a National Park and what is their Purpose in New South Wales (NSW)?

Q1. What is a National Park?
• What is a National Park (NP) in your country?
• What are the famous NPs in your country?
• Do you know any famous NPs in Australia?



Q2. What is the primary purpose of a National Park?
• What is their purpose in your country?
• What is their purpose in Australia? Does this differ to your country?



This [site](https://npansw.org.au/what-we-do/why-are-national-parks-important/) explains why national parks are important.

* [This](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/parks-australia-science-direction-statement-2018-2022-v2.pdf) is how the Australian Federal Government describes it from their perspective of looking after “Commonwealth National Parks”:
* [This](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/conservation-and-heritage/our-parks) is how the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NSW NPWS) describes it, in more detail [here](https://blog.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/whats-a-national-park-and-why-does-it-matter/), and they describe their role [here](http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/about-npws/what-we-do).
* [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park) is a more international viewpoint, and includes the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) definition of “protected areas”. If you are interested in a more legal statement [here](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/npawa1974247/s30e.html) is the definition of a National Park under the (NSW) National Park and Wildlife Act 1974.



### Part B: Conflicts regarding Purpose

The ‘purpose’ of a national park potentially leads to conflicts between different stakeholders (either within or bordering the park) . An issue at the moment is the management of wild horses in Kosciuszko National Park: although this is not directly relevant to Sydney it serves the purpose here as an example.

See:

  An example closer to Sydney is the culling of feral deer in the Royal National Park. Another example
  is the management of fires within national parks.

Q3. What do you think are the primary conflicts associated with National Parks in the Sydney
region?



### Part C: What are the Major Parks of the Sydney Region?

The NSW NPWS website is very comprehensive: for “Sydney and surrounds” they list 161 reserves!
This is [here](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/regions/sydney-and-surrounds). These reserves are national parks, nature reserves, State conservation areas and some are regional
parks (you might want to consider what the difference is?).

On the [map](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/regions/sydney-and-surrounds/map):
Q4: What are the major National Parks of the Sydney Region? You might like to ponder consider why or what makes a ‘major’ park?

Q5: What are the major features of these parks? (only need to give a very brief summary)

Q6. There are 5 UNESCO World Heritage sites in NSW: which one is also a national park?

* What makes a World Heritage site?

* Why is that national park included?

This can be answered using this site:

### Part D: The Adequacy of our Reserves

Q7: if you were going to design a new reserve system in a completely ‘natural’ ‘pristine’ ‘wilderness’, how would you go about it? This is considered by the Federal government, for example at [here](http://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/about-nrs/requirements) and [here](http://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/scientific-framework).

For the NSW State government [this](https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/parks-reserves-and-protected-areas/establishing-new-parks-and-protected-areas) document is relevant:
The basic principle behind the protected reserve system is ‘CAR’: comprehensive, adequate and representative.

Q8: Is the reserve system of the Sydney region “CAR”? And if not, what is missing?
