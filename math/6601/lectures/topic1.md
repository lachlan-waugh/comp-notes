# the physical environment

Located at 33°51'54'' S, 151°12'34'' in the South-Eastern hemisphere



### overview

* relatively isolated, large and flat
* geologically old and stable
* driest inhabited continent
* strange soils



#### this has caused

* high biological diversity
* high endemicity (species only occuring in Australia)
* biota  with unique adaptations to dry/variable climate
* unique structural formations, biotic and behavioural adaptations
* susceptibility to extinctions



#### elevation and relief

* large, but sparsely populated
* the flatest continent
* lowest average elevation (330m), lowest elevation, and absolute relief
* eastern seaboard is flanked by the great escaprpment and the great dividing range



#### major landform features: mountains plateaux, and plains

* west: blue mountains, north hornsby plateau, south woronora plateau. central cumberland plain (incorrectly sydney basin)
* sydney basin refers to the larger geological feature, not the smaller central sydney



### rivers

* great dividing range separates eastwards flowing rivers from westward flowing ones
* no major river runs through sydney, hawkesbury nepean runs around it



#### hawkesbury-napean

* indigenous name = Deerubbin
* catchment area >20000km^2
* source of sydneys water supply
* headwaters to south and west of sydney
* downstream is hawkesbury, upstream is napean
* Discovered by two different people, didn't realise it was the same river



## climate and vegetation

Sydney basin is a physiographic region, a biogeographic region



#### australian climate

strongly controlled by large scale phenomena:

* subtropical high pressure belt
* equatorial low pressure belt
* trade winds
* mid-latitude westerlies



also characterised by variability

* walker circulation
* southern annual mode
* indian ocean dipole



#### drivers of the sydney climate

* hadley cell



* atmospheric circulation over australia, a high pressure system,
  * 800km per day
  * average periodicity of 6.9 days
  * shift 5-10\* towards equator
  * stronger in winter
