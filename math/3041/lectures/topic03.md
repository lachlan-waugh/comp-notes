Fitting Real World Data
---

### Tasks for model fitting

1. fitting a selected model type/s to data
2. choosing the most appropriate model from competing fitted types
3. making predictions from the collected data

> **1 & 2** are concerned with the ability of the model to explain observed behaviour
> **3** is concerned with prediction of the behaviour within some range of interest



### Sources of error

1. *Formulation*: oversimplication/neglecting certain variables
2. *Truncation*: numerical method errors (e.g. finite version of infinite sums)
3. *Round-off*: insufficient precision in calculations
4. *Measurement*: imprecision in data collection (human error/equipment limitations)



### Considerations

1. Number of data points
2. Range of data the model is to be used
3. Spacing of the data points (unequal spacing biases weighting of a fit)
4. Accuracy of data (how was it collected, accuracy of equipment, any outliers?)



### Linear correlation
