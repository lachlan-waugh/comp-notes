## Classifying emotions - discrete vs dimensional

### Notes

Discrete emotions: 

Dimensional emotions: 

One approach is to identify discrete emotions that are distinct and separate from one another. In general, these approaches argue that emotions should be considered distinct categories that are naturally delineated.

Not all species exhibit the six universal emotions of discrete emotion theory

Dimensional emotion theory: Dimensional accounts of emotion argue that, instead of being entirely distinct categories, emotions exist along spectrums or dimensions.

	* valence, which varies from positive to negative
	* hysiological arousal, which varies from high to low

### Transcript

In our last lecture we spoke a bit about the different components of emotions. Just like the scientific theories of emotion, we decided that the main components are:

a stimulus that cues the onset of the emotion

thoughts or cognitions

physiological symptoms like a change in heart rate

and behaviours that are associated with that particular emotion.

But how do our body and mind tell the difference between different emotions? How do we know when we’re are angry versus when we’re afraid? 

Do we just know because the feelings are sooo different or is there some overlap in the components of different emotions?

Let’s compare the components of two different emotions, anger and fear, and see if we can work out how our bodies and minds might do this.

 

So, in the last lecture we already decided that some of the components of anger were:

An event that we interpreted as wrong, unfair or unjust

Thoughts related to the situation and being wronged, and lastly 

Physiological symptoms like our heart racing and our palms getting sweaty

Behaviours such as standing in a particular way or approaching the person who committed the act that we interpreted as unjust.

So, what about fear? Are the components of fear different and are there any situations where the components of anger and fear might be similar?

Event For some people, events that trigger anger might be very different than events that trigger fear. But it’s also not hard to imagine a situation that could trigger either or even both of these emotions! 

If a person witnessed a drunken stranger staggering around and screaming racist abuse at no one in particular, the person might feel angry that someone would say such awful words, but they may also be simultaneously afraid of what this person might do next.

Physiology A person witnessing this situation might start sweating, their heart might start racing. If you looked closely you might notice their pupils dilating. 

But if you only had those pieces of information – sweating, racing heart and dilated pupils – what emotion would you say that person is feeling? Anger? Fear? Love?!

Thoughts Let’s see if our thoughts are better at helping us work out which particular emotion we’re feeling. 

Sometimes the content of our thoughts helps us out a great deal; an angry person might think, “Oh, you horrible person! How dare you say that,” whereas a scared person might think, “Oh geez, just stay over there, don’t look at me, don’t look at me!”

But in a really tense situation it can sometimes be difficult to think clearly. A person's thoughts may be more along the lines of, “Gaaahh...”. Good luck deciphering which emotion a person is feeling from just that piece of information!

Behaviour When it comes to the behaviours that different emotions elicit these can usually give us helpful clues, for example the way that facial expressions do. Different emotions can also prompt even more obvious motivational behaviours like approaching the stimulus if we’re angry or avoiding the stimulus and backing away if we’re scared. 

But this doesn’t mean that we can always just use behaviour to work out which emotion people are feeling. Have you ever heard of "putting on a brave face"? Just because we’re feeling a certain emotion doesn’t necessarily mean we’re going to show the corresponding expression on our faces.

And this really drives home how important it is to consider all of the components together. When your body and mind decipher which emotion is being felt, it’s not a simple matter of just interpreting physiological reactions or just behaviours and then suddenly being able to work out which emotion is being felt. Interpreting emotions is a complicated process and certainly not as easy to do as people may intuitively think.

So, if it’s really difficult to decipher and categorise our emotions, then how do scientists do it? Well, there are a couple of main approaches. One approach is to identify discrete emotions that are distinct and separate from one another. In general, these approaches argue that emotions should be considered distinct categories that are naturally delineated.

Within each of those categories the experiences are similar. Importantly, they’re similar in ways that we can observe and measure. So, things that we can observe and measure might be behaviours like facial expressions or the physiological changes that happen in our bodies like our heart rate. Emotion researchers have observed that anger and fear tend to have different clusters of thoughts, behaviours and physiological responses. . And so, at its core, the discrete emotion approach argues that anger is a different category of emotion to fear. And both of those are different categories of experience to sadness, for example. 

This discreet approach to emotion also argues that each instance of anger – so, each of the different times the person was angry – that person’s thoughts, behaviours and physiological responses were pretty similar to each other.



Perhaps the most well-known proponent of the discreet emotion approach is Paul Ekman. Ekman spent decades travelling around the world to many different literate and non-literate cultures. His research found that you could show any one of these faces to pretty much anyone of any gender, from any culture around the world and the overwhelming majority of people from any culture would be able to correctly identify which emotion the person was feeling. And so, he argued that happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise and anger are Universal Basic Emotions that are fundamentally distinct from one another and occur across all cultures.

The striking thing about this basic emotion approach is that, even when researchers have used very different methods in their experiments, and even different species, they often “converge on many of the same basic emotions, despite having emerged from very different research traditions”. 

For example, Jaak Panksepp used electrodes to stimulate different brain areas in non-human animals; that is obviously very different form Ekman’s methods! But just like Ekman he still derived a list of basic emotions very similar to Ekman, including fear, rage and joy or play.

Because lots of different researchers have used lots of different research methods and found essentially the same thing, what that tells us is that the discreet approach does have scientific merit. But this doesn’t mean it’s perfect. 

One of the early criticisms is that not all animals exhibit the behaviours and physiological reactions that the discrete basic emotion approach would predict. Earthworms, for example, only show behaviours like approaching a stimulus or avoiding a stimulus. And so, other researchers argue a more evolutionarily ancient system is more accurate in explaining how we feel emotions and how our bodies tell the difference between them.

Dimensional accounts of emotion argue that, instead of being entirely distinct categories, emotions exist along spectrums or dimensions. The most common dimensions that scientists consider are valence, which varies from positive to negative, and physiological arousal, which varies from high to low. A number of researchers also talk about motivation, varying from approach to avoidance. And there’s good evidence that some form of approach/avoid motivational system is present in all animals from earthworms to pigeons, rats to humans. 

Dimensional accounts argue that these much more basal psychological processes can explain the emotional components that we’re observing. And this is a really important point, the principle of parsimony. In science, if there are two different theories that both explain the phenomena we’re observing then the theory that relies on simpler processes is more likely to be correct than the one that relies on complex processes. The exception to this rule is when both accounts seem to have some utility in different situations. We’ll come back to that point in a moment!



One of the most common dimensional models of emotion is the Circumplex Model of Affect which was proposed by James Russell in 1980. According to this account, emotions can be classified in terms of where they sit on the two dimensions of valence and arousal. 







Have a go at working out where the following emotions fall on these axes. 



How did you go? 





As you can see here, Russell mapped lots of emotions along these dimensions. So, both excited and relaxed might be roughly equivalent in terms of positivity but excited is going to be much higher in arousal than relaxed. Similarly, afraid and bored are similar in negativity, but afraid is higher in physiological arousal than bored.



Now, like so many debates in science - and pretty much every aspect of life - the Discreet and Dimensional approaches are generally pitted against one another and considered like an either/or situation. But maybe approaches have utility and value; maybe they’re not mutually exclusive. 

Eddie Harmon-Jones is one researcher who advocates for both approaches. He thinks that instead of arguing and trying to disprove the other theory, researchers should be looking at all of the evidence together and trying to come up with ways to integrate the strengths of both perspectives.





So, why should we consider both? Well, as Harmon-Jones argues, sometimes one classification system will be relevant and at other times the other system is more useful. 

For example, in one experiment when participants felt the emotion fear, the participants directed their attention towards threatening stimuli. On the other hand, participants who were made to feel neutral, excited or angry didn’t show that same tendency to focus on the threat. Those participants just looked around at other things.

And so, you can see that in some instances, a discrete emotion can cause specific, observable effects. So, even though it relies on more complex psychological processes, the discreet emotion account does have the power to explain and predict our emotional experiences in certain circumstances.



At other times, however, a dimensional approach might be more relevant. 

For example, there’s this phenomenon called cognitive scope. It’s essentially the hierarchical level that we analyse stimuli at. 

Super abstract idea but think of it as the concept behind that proverb “you can’t see the forest for the trees.” Sometimes, you’re analysing the world at such a fine level of detail that you can’t see the big picture.

Anyway, cognitive scope - whether we’re focusing on the fine detail or the big picture – that phenomenon is actually affected by our emotions. And there’s some good evidence that the motivational intensity of the emotion is what drives this effect. Let me explain... 

So, for a long time scientists thought it was all about valence - positive emotions narrowed our cognitive scope and negative emotions broadened or cognitive scope. They essentially thought that happy people were more likely to see tiny letters, the proverbial trees and sad people were more likely to see the bigger letter, the proverbial forest. 

But it turns out this isn’t quite right. Instead, motivational intensity, so the intensity to which the emotion compels us to approach or avoid the stimulus, that seems to be driving this effect not whether the emotion is positive or negative.

 

In 2008, Gable and Harmon-Jones showed participants either pictures high in approach motivation, pictures like chocolate and pictures low in motivational intensity, like pictures of rocks.

They found that after seeing a stimulus high in approach motivation, like chocolate, participants were more likely to have a narrowed cognitive scope and see the tiny figures, compared to being shown images with lower motivational intensity. 

And so, you can see that in this case, the dimensional approach is really valuable in this case because it accurately explains the phenomena that was observed.



And remember that that characteristic was one of the features of a good scientific theory; it should explain what we’re observing. Now that our understanding of the dimensional account has been updated, it can also help us to predict what will happen in the future, as we’ll see in the next lecture!

Thanks for watching! In this lecture we talked about Discreet and Dimensional accounts of emotion. We looked at some research in support of each account and discussed why both have utility.

Next time we’ll delve deeper into these ideas when we look at Theories of Emotion.
