## The science of emotions

### Notes

Emotions vs moods

* Emotions are shorter in duration, more specific, and tend to occur in response to a stimulus/cue
* Moods can last days to months, and not have a specific cause.
* Moods can be harder to pinpoint than emotions, they are more diffuse/vague



Affect: an umbrella term used to refer to clusters of experiences (mood, emotions, and feelings, and their valence)

* valence: the positive/negativeness of the emotion/mood/feeling/etc



Six universal emotions

* Joy or happiness
* Sadness
* Surprise
* Anger
* Fear, and
* Disgust



Emotions are made up of

* a response to some sort of trigger or stimulus
* cognition – so, the those thoughts that ran through your head e.g. “it’s not fair” 
* physiology – e.g. bodily changes
* behaviour - particular expression on your face, stand in a certain way or even yell
* conscious experiences - this refers to the things that you are aware of amidst all this, contextual cues, smells, the environment around you; all the things you are consciously aware of.



### Transcript

What is an emotion? Intuitively you’d think that this would be easy to define. Everyone knows what emotions are. They’re our feelings, right? Mmm... maybe. But then what’s a feeling? It’s er... what we feel, like, our emotions. 

Not very scientific, hey?

Defining what an emotion is, is really tricky. And so, it’s probably not surprising that scientists can’t agree on a definition either! Truly, there is no single, widely accepted definition of what an emotion is or what causes emotions. 

As you probably gathered from last week’s lecture on the scientific method, researchers disagree a lot and so many emotion researchers have slightly different definitions. They do agree on some aspects though, so let’s start there.

Most researchers can agree on what emotions are not. Although in conversation we might use words like feelings, emotions, moods, or affect interchangeably, for scientists, these terms are not the same thing.

Most scientists agree that emotions are shorter in duration than moods and emotions also tend to have an “aboutness”. What this means is that is emotions tend to occur in response to some sort of stimulus or cue; they tend to be more specific than moods. 

For example, that kid Johnny in the playground stole your ice cream. You immediately feel angry; you’re hot and tense and your heart is pounding. Your emotion is about the event that happened to you. A little bit later you notice you’re feeling better because you're playing with some other kids who are nice to you. You can see that in this scenario, your emotions changed from anger to happy in a pretty short space of time and in response to specific events.

Moods on the other hand, can last anywhere from days to months, and they don’t have that same aboutness that emotions do. You might just wake up one day and feel a bit low, without any specific stimulus or event that caused it. 

Moods are also more diffuse than emotions; they’re a bit more vague. Whereas we can often specify our emotions - “I feel angry” - moods can be a bit harder to pinpoint. 

Finally, we have affect and this is broader still. Affect is a broad umbrella term that can be used to refer to clusters of experiences, including mood, emotions and feelings, as well as the valence of these thing. Valence simply refers to the “positiveness” or “negativeness”. So, a “good” mood versus a “bad” mood.





Now, because we’re all human beings and we’ve all felt emotions, surely that gives us at least some insight into what emotions are and how they should be defined. Right? So, let’s consider our own experiences of emotions and we can see how these ideas match up to scientists’ ideas a bit later.



Take a moment to think about some emotions that you’ve felt. Can you name them? Take a moment to list some emotions.





How did you go? 

Some scientists have described emotions in terms of primary emotions and secondary emotions. The primary emotions are sometimes referred to as the “6 universal emotions” because virtually every culture on the planet recognises them. If you ever saw the movie Inside/Out then these might be familiar to you:

Joy or happiness

Sadness

Surprise

Anger

Fear and

Disgust

Other emotions you may have listed might be considered secondary emotions or even culture-specific emotions. Some of these types of emotions include embarrassment, guilt, resentment, apprehension and the culturally specific emotion schadenfreude, the German term for when a person feels pleasure at someone else’s misfortune.

So, we’ve all felt emotions but how do we know when we’re experiencing a specific emotion? What are the components that make up that emotion? Let’s look at an example and then see if we can come up with some ideas.

Now, imagine you’re 5 years old and your teenage sister is baby-sitting you at home while your parents are out. Your sister makes for herself the most delicious double scoop choc fudge ice cream sundae with chocolate sauce and marshmallows and sprinkles. The works. 

You’re waiting patiently. Waiting. Waiting... and then you politely ask, “Can I have one too?” Your sister glances over and says in a condescending voice, “Oh what a shame, I’ve just finished all the choc fudge ice cream, and there’s no more chocolate sauce or marshmallows or anything either. But there might be like half a scoop of vanilla left in the freezer." So, she scrapes the last icy, freezer-burnt scraps of the boring vanilla into a bowl, slides it across the table, blinks at you and says “Here”.

How might you feel in this situation? 

Angry, right?! 

Ok, so let’s take a look at what components made up that emotion - anger. 

What happened just before you got angry? There’s some sort of event or stimulus that triggers your anger. Just like other emotions, anger has “aboutness” - we don’t just feel emotions for no reason, we feel anger about something. Often, it’s when we’ve been wronged by someone or feel a sense of injustice.

What thoughts might have run through your head when you were angry? In psychology, we call thoughts cognitions. Some of the cognitions that might have gone through your head are “That’s wrong!” or “It’s not fair!”

Now, what clues in your body might tell you that you’re angry? The physiological changes that happen in our body can sometimes give us an indication that we’re feeling a particular emotion. When you’re angry, you might feel your heart racing, your palms might get sweaty, your cheeks might flush.

And now that you’re angry, what might you do? What behaviours does anger provoke? Someone who’s angry might pull a face like this [image] or they might stand like this [image]. When you’ve been angry, did you raise your voice? Some people might even get aggressive or violent when they’re angry.



Ok, so this is our folk theory definition of anger; we’d say that emotions are made up of:

A stimulus

Cognitions

Physiological symptoms and

Behaviours.

How does our folk theory definition compare a scientists’ definition of emotion?



Well, it turns out that these components come up in lots of different scientific theories of emotion. They don’t feature in all theories of emotion but when you look at lots of theories collectively, these are the components they all seem to cover.

In a recent commentary paper about measuring emotion, researcher Peter Kuppens wrote that emotions involve:

A response to some sort of trigger or stimulus - just like in our example when your emotion was in response to your sister’s actions

Cognition – so, the those thoughts that ran through your head e.g. “it’s not fair” 

Physiology – think about those bodily changes we spoke about like your heart racing or your cheeks turning red

Behaviour - so you might show a particular expression on your face, you might stand in a certain way or even yell

And conscious experiences - this refers to the things that you are aware of amidst all this, contextual cues, smells, the environment around you; all the things you are consciously aware of.

Now, like I said, not all theories will look at all of these components together, and they certainly won’t look at them in the same way. Some theories might focus on just one aspect and another theory might focus on something different. But the important part to remember is that when you look at the theories in the literature collectively, as a whole, these are the components that those theories all seem to cover.





Thanks for watching! In this lecture we covered what emotions are, what they’re not, we defined mood and affect, and we looked at the components that make up our different emotions. 

In the next lecture we’ll take a closer look at emotions and talk about how different emotions affect our body. We’ll look at how our body and brain uses these components to work out which particular emotion we’re feeling at any given time.
