### Transcript

What do you think of when I say the word “scientist”? Do you imagine someone standing in a lab, wearing a white coat, looking down microscopes and maybe pouring something into a test tube?

Do you imagine someone who looks like this? Or this? 

But science isn’t all evil madmen or making things explode. Actually, in psychology things definitely should not explode!

A scientist is simply a person who uses the scientific method to collect and interpret information about the world. Scientists observe phenomena in the real world and then use these observations to answer questions. The questions that scientists explore can be anything from, “Why is the sky blue?” to “Why are some people afraid of heights?” Scientists make their observations and answer their questions in a very specific way. The method they use seeks to reduce error and minimise bias. And so, the scientific method is probably best described as a tool used to understand ourselves and the world around us.



Before we get started, I want to get all Mythbusters on you and dispel some of the common misunderstandings about science. You might have heard some of these myths in the media or in advertising. 



“This product is scientifically proven…” Yeah, that’s a myth! The scientific method does not and cannot ever prove anything to the point of absolute certainty. Instead, scientific progress is made in a bit of a roundabout way - incorrect ideas get disproven so only the most accurate ideas survive! It’s a bit like a giant game of intellectual dodgeball. A scientist observes an event and then puts forward an idea that explains how and why that phenomenon occurred. In science we call these explanations a theory.

The scientific community then takes aim at that theory and makes it their mission to see if they can disprove it! Everyone tries to find evidence that that idea is wrong. If another researcher can demonstrate that the theory isn’t quite right, then the theory either gets revised or, if it’s really wrong, the theory gets knocked out of existence. And so, in this roundabout way, theories often gain support when more and more people try to disprove the idea but fail to do so! 

And you can see how this process becomes really powerful when decades’ worth of observations all follow the pattern that the theory predicts. Basically, if a theory can stand up to literally thousands of scientists all trying to disprove it, and none of them can find evidence that the theory is wrong, then we can be pretty confident that we’re on the right track; the theory is probably close to representing the actual state of affairs in the world.



Now, that doesn’t mean us scientists have free reign to just make stuff up! If the idea is actually impossible to refute then it’s not just “not a good theory”, it’s not science! Say, for example, I proposed that reality doesn’t exist and we’re all just living in The Matrix. Ha! Disprove that! Well, I can’t. But I also can’t provide any objective, unbiased and reliable observations that support the idea either! Who knows, the idea may be right, it may be wrong. 

But if it's not possible to investigate an idea in an objective, unbiased and reliable way, then those ideas are not falsifiable. Remember how I said that science progresses by disproving ideas? Well, by definition, unfalsifiable ideas are impossible to prove wrong, so they’re outside the realms of what the scientific method can investigate. Because of this, they’re best left to philosophers and other experts to debate.



Ok, so if science is the process of making observations in a particular way to understand the world, how are those observations actually made? And how do we investigate things that we can’t really see, like love, cooperation or fear? We use the scientific method.



The scientific method starts off with a theory. We noted before that a scientific theory is not just a hunch, it is a detailed explanation of how and why a particular phenomenon occurs. The theory is based on the observations that other researchers have made previously, and it also makes predictions about what will happen in certain situations in the future.

Now, if you’re new to science, then all these concepts might sound a bit abstract, so let’s look at an example to make things easier.  

Sometime around the year 1665, Sir Isaac Newtown was in his father’s apple orchid and watched an apple fall to the ground. There are rumours that the apple hit him on the head, but he likely just made that bit up to embellish the story! Anyway, Newton wondered why apples always fall in a straight line down towards the ground. Why do they never fall crooked or sideways or fly up into the air? He proposed that this phenomenon - falling straight down - was due to a force that attracted objects to each other. This was Newton’s theory and it eventually became his law of universal gravitation.

You can see in this example that Newton started with an observation – apples always fall straight down, and then he asked a research question - why do they do this? The theory he proposed to answer this question was that every object in the universe possesses an invisible force proportionate to its mass and this force draws different objects together. Gravity! There are lots of predictions that arise from this theory, from the way that apples fall from trees to the movement of planets.



Scientists today still follow the same basic steps that Newton did. The scientist observes a phenomenon and proposes a theory to explain what they’ve observed. The theory suggests a number of predictions and then researchers test those predictions in experiments. If the predictions are right, then their experimental observations act as evidence in support of the theory. But if the evidence runs contrary to the theory’s predictions then that theory’s been hit by the dodgeball! The theory either needs to be modified or scrapped!



Given the rigid way in which science progresses, it probably comes as no surprise that the experiments themselves are run in a very specific way too.

To run a scientific experiment, the researcher first looks at all the predictions that those existing theories make, and they identify a prediction that hasn’t been tested yet. This is sometimes referred to as the research gap. The researcher then expresses the prediction as a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a very specific prediction about what you think is going to occur just in your particular experiment. So, whereas the theory might make a whole range of predictions, from how apples fall from trees to how the moon will circle the earth, the hypothesis is a single prediction that is only concerned with your small area of investigation. 

Once you’ve developed your hypothesis that predicts exactly what you think is going to occur in your experiment, you get to do the fun bit – run the experiment and collect the data.

We’ll be talking a lot about emotions in this course so let’s use fear for our example. How do we measure fear? We probably won’t get very reliable or valid results if we asked people to measure their fear like this:

What we need is some way of measuring fear that is unambiguous. When scientists define a variable according to how they’re going to be measured. This is known as operationalising the variable. 

For my experiment I’m going to operationalise fear by measuring how high a person jumps when I stand behind them and say Boo! And yeah, this still might seem a bit silly but defining fear as “the height that a person startles in cm” has all the characteristics that we want when we operationalise a variable:

• It's observable, so I could set up a slow-motion video camera and a tape measure and I could observe how much they startle.

• It’s objective. This method doesn’t rely on anyone’s interpretation. We look at the video, we look at the tape measure and we calculate our answer.

• It’s also replicable, and this means that any researcher in the world could run the experiment themselves and see if they get the same results. This trait of replicability is really important because us scientists are pretty sceptical. We don’t just believe everything we hear. We want evidence. And when that evidence seems a bit too good to be true, sometimes the only thing that is going to calm our naysaying voices is to take matters into our own hands and replicate the experiment ourselves.

• Finally - and this bit might seem pretty obvious - but it’s also really important that we’re actually measuring the factor that we think we’re measuring. This concept is known as validity. If we were going to get people to measure their arm or forehead with a tape measure, then we’re not actually measuring “fear”. Those measurements are not going to be influenced by things like height, not fear. And while measuring fear in cm when someone says Boo! might seem a bit weird, the concept that we’re taping into is a phenomenon known as fear potentiated startle - it’s essentially where the more scared someone is, the higher they jump when they hear a loud, unexpected noise.



Now that we know how we’re going to measure fear, we need to design and conduct the experiment that will answer our research question. Remember how Isaac Newton’s research questions was “Why do apples fall straight down?” well, my research question is “Do scary movies make people afraid?”

The way I’m going to test this is to have half the participants watch the movie Jaws and the other half watch a really boring movie; they’re going to watch a video of someone painting a fence. The boring movie will function as a control condition. Controls are really important in science because, just like with validity, we want to be sure that the variable we’re interested in is driving the effect that we observe. We don’t want some other unknown variable to have caused the trend in our results. So, in our experiment, we want to know that scary movies are causing people to be afraid. We don’t want to risk the possibility that all movies put people on edge regardless of their genre. Who knows, maybe being in a dark room full of strangers just puts people on edge; it’s plausible. And so, control conditions ensure that all participants experience the same conditions except for the specific variable that we’re interested in.

We’ve now got two groups, an experimental group that will watch the scary movie and a control group that will watch the boring movie. So, everyone watches a movie in the same dark movie cinema, but the factor that we’re manipulating is whether the movie is scary or not. The technical term for this factor is the independent variable. The independent variable is the variable that is manipulated by the experimenter or you can think of it as a “grouping variable”. Our groups are the “Jaws watching group” and the “watching paint dry group”, so our independent variable is the scariness of the movie.

We’re then going to measure the person’s fear using our Boo! test. The variable that gets measured in an experiment is called the dependent variable. The dependent variable is called the “dependent” variable because, if our hypothesis is correct, then the amount of fear that each participant will show will depend on whether they watched a scary movie or not. This can be hard to get your head around so let me explain it another way, the degree to which each participant expresses fear [the dependent variable] depends on which movie they watched [the independent variable]. The amount of dependent variable that the participant expresses will depend on which independent variable they were exposed to.

Now, just as an aside, you’ve probably noticed that right throughout this lecture I’ve used the word participants. Psychologists used to call the people who took part in their experiments “subjects”, but researchers now recognise that the people who volunteer to take part in experiments play an active role in scientific progress. They’re not just passively subjected to the experiment. And so, they’re now more accurately referred to as participants rather than subjects.



Ok, so we’ve finished running our experiment; half the participants watched Jaws and the other half watched a boring video, we then said Boo! to each participant and we measured how much they startled. We’ve now tallied up our results to see whether the Jaws group jumped higher. This is probably the most exciting part of the research process because it’s where we see if our observations supported or refuted our hypothesis.

Let’s pretend that we ran a whole lot of statistical tests on our data and found out that the participants who watched Jaws jumped significantly higher than the people who watched the boring video. We could conclude that the results of our experiment supported the hypothesis that scary movies make people afraid. Remember, we didn’t prove it but we did 

But this obviously isn’t the end of the story. What about Jaws 2? Do people startle the same in Jaws 1 and Jaws 2? What about other scary movies? And what other factors influence a person’s tendency to startle after watching a scary movie? Do teenagers jump more than adults or vice versa? Which gender or genders startle the most and why? 

Most of the time, once one research gap is plugged many more questions are raised so more hypotheses are developed and then tested.

And so, you can see that science is a circular process. It’s always continuing; it’s an ongoing, never ending process. And this links back to what I was talking about earlier; science isn’t about providing absolute proof or constantly making massive scientific breakthroughs. It’s not about that. What science is really about is this incremental, iterative, circular process; constantly updating our understanding of the world, to a point where we can be pretty sure that we’re understanding the world better. That’s the scientific method.



Thanks for watching! In this lecture we talked about scientists and the scientific method. We defined terms like theory and hypothesis, independent and dependent variables, operational definitions, and how to run a basic experiment.

Next week we’re going to see how psychological scientists put this all into practice in The Science of Emotion.
