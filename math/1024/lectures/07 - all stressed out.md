## Stress

* A response in the body when there is a demand for change in our body
* An attempt to return body to equilibrium/homeostasis.
* "A painful blow and a passionate kiss can be equally stressful"



### Types

* **Physiology disturbances**: Injuries, illness, infection



### Uses

* Important biological function, necessary for survival (immune responses to healing, recovering from injury).
* Hormone burst for pain relief
* Hepls adapt to and regulate daily experiences, metabolism, sleeping
* Stress hormones get us up in the morning
* Exposure to stress before learning can enhance learning for implicit memory and associative learning (and explicit memory)
* Stress is motivation



### When is stress good (motivated performance)

* Intensity of stress determines if it's helpful or harmful
* Bell curve of stress and performance
* Moderate stress gives best performance
* chronicity: duration of the stress
  * short-term acute stress is helpful, long-term is bad



### Changes

* constant stress is like pressure pushing one direction, adapt to it
* chronic stress changes HPA axis
* Consistrently elevated cortisol
  * body becomes resistant to hormones
  * thresholds for responding to change get messed up
  * chronic inflamation (epigenetic changes, gene expression is altered)
  * especially genes controlling reaction to stress hormones



## Cognitive appraisal and mindsets

### biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat

* applies to situations of motivated performance
* appraisal about the situation we're in, not general beliefs
* appraise the **demand of the task**, and **personal resources to cope**



### response

* respond with challenge or threat state
  * **challenge**: situation we can cope with
  * **threat**: we can't cope with
* can have a big impact on stress respond



### challenge state

* more helpful, different physiological profile
* SAM system increases heart rate/blood flow
* responsive reactivity: stress response switches on/off more rapidly, causing faster return to homeostasis once challenge dealt with



### threat state

* activates SAM and HPA Axis
* dampens the SAM response (for cardiac output)
* longer stress response (cortisol in blood stream)



### encourage challenge state

* way to encourage appraisal with challenge state
* reappraise physiological arousal as an extra resource
* general belief about stress
* fixed minset vs growth mindset
  * **fixed**: a person's ability is unable to change
  * **growth**: people can grow overtime (seek challenges)



### enhancing mindset

* positive beliefs about stress give challenge state
* enhancing minmdset had greater life satisfaction, fewer anxiety/depression symptoms, higher dispositional resources (optimism, resilience, mindfulness). more moderate cortisol reactivity, greater desire for feedback from peers/evaluators
* Effects of skewing results were short-term and not enduring



Minimise external demands

Increase internal resources (hunger, thirst, exhaustion, loneliness)

### Lecture 1

We’ve all heard about stress, but what is it really? And how is it different to fear and anxiety? Is it all bad? And what possible purpose could it have? 

In this lecture we’re going to take a deep dive into the land of stress, the good, the bad and the… why…



So, first up. What is stress? Stress is actually **a really broad, non-specific response that happens in the body when there is ANY demand for change made on our bodies**. Stress is our body’s attempts to restore some sort of equilibrium and return the body to homeostasis after that demand. It’s like if you are trying to balance and stand up straight, but small things might happen to tilt you slightly off balance, so the stress response is your body’s way of responding to help prop you back up straight again. And it doesn’t need to be something bad or threatening like a punch that’s going to tilt you off balance, it could be something awesome like a hug or a high five. Or a really awkward elbow bump…

So, the stress response isn’t something that only happens in fear and anxiety. It can include those things but it’s more broad than that. Stress occurs in response to change, and those things can be nice or not so nice. There’s this awesome quote by Hungarian endorcrinologist Hans Seyle, he’s basically the founder of stress theories, and he said that **“a painful blow and a passionate kiss can be equally stressful.”** 



So, if stress can be good stuff or bad stuff, what kinds of things can be stressful? Well, stress can come in a range of forms. For example, we see physical stressors. These can include actual disturbances to our physiology that are going on right now, so things like injuries or illnesses, or if your body has an infection. That’s all classified as stress.

We also see psychological stressors too. These might be similar to anxiety like anticipating a perceived threat, or it could be anticipating aversive environmental stimuli like knowing you’ve gotta go outside when it’s really cold and raining and windy and you’ve left your jacket at home. It could be detecting cues for threat or predators, or even just a failure to satisfy your basic internal drives such as hunger, thirst or sleep. Ever been hangry?



Now, we’ve all likely heard that stress is B.A.D. It’s something that can be damaging and should be avoided at all costs. One meta-analysis found that stress was associated with shorter leukocyte telomeres – if you know what these are, please let me know on the forums! High levels of stress is associated with greater illness frequency, greater incidence of obesity, poorer general health, greater progression of physical disability, increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, reduced cognitive capability as well as issues with your cardiovascular system, like hypertension, affect carotid intima-media thickness, contribute to coronary artery calcification. Oh yeah, and increased risk of sudden coronary death and death from any cause. So, yeah. Too much stress can straight up kill you.



Buuuuut it’s not that simple. Stress serves a really important biological function and is necessary for survival. Remember that whole fight or flight thing? It’s what helps us jump out of the way if a car is coming or and then when we trip over and twist our ankle, it gives us that hormone burst for pain relief. Physiologically, stress is involved in many important processes for survival, from immune responses to healing and recovering from injuries. 

At a daily level too, stress also allows the body to adapt to and regulate daily experiences like the role of cortisol in regulating our activities levels, metabolism, as well as sleep and waking up. Truly, stress hormones are literally what get us up in the morning! 

Stress has also been shown to enhance our cognitive and physical performance. There was a review in 2013 that showed that exposure to stress before learning or training can enhance your learning for implicit memory and associative learning, and also explicit memory to some extent but we’ll come back to explicit memory in a sec.  So, you can see that stress is actually pretty important. It helps with that whole living stuff.

So, how do we reconcile these two bodies of evidence? We’ve just heard that stress can flat out kill you but also that it’s 100% integral for survival..



How do we know when stress is helpful versus harmful? Well, as with anything, it’s complicated. There are a BUNCH of different factors that cover a range of different areas of stress. Given our time limits, we will only cover a few of these factors and we’ll focus mostly on stress relating to **motivated performance**, like doing well in sport or work or uni! 



So, the first thing that determines whether the stress is going to be helpful or harmful is the intensity of the stressor. You may have seen this funny squiggle before, it’s called a Yerkes-Dodson curve, after it’s discoverers Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson who worked out in 1908 that your level of arousal influenced how well you performed on different tasks. If you have no stress at all, then you probably aren’t motivated to do much and won’t perform very well. So, you need a little bit of stress to help pep you up and literally get you out of bed. But, if you get too much, you’ll get overwhelmed, and your performance will drop down. Sooooo, you get this bell curve with optimal stress levels here in the middle. 



Remember how I spoke about explicit memory before – how great was that joke? I was getting them to remember the memory experiment and…

Anyway, in that experiment by Sandi that we talked about a minute ago, you can see that Yerkes Dodson curve playing out. You can see how when there’s a moderate amount of stress or arousal then performance is best, but when there’s just too much, performance drops down again. So, intensity really does play a role. 

![img](file:///tmp/lu413171ayqfj.tmp/lu413171ayqhw_tmp_4f4183b9f8ff0c0d.png)



The next factor is the **chronicity** or duration of the stress. So, there’s a pretty good body of evidence suggesting that although a short-term acute stress response can be helpful, if the stress is something that’s ongoing and draws out over a long period of time, that can be unhelpful and can lead to some of the unhelpful health effects we talked about earlier. 



We’ve talked about how the stress response is kind of this balancing act, where when something happens to tip you over one way your body responds to balance that. Well, what happens with chronic stress, is that if there’s this constant pressure pushing you over on one side. It’s like the muscles on the other side bulk up heaps to constantly exert force to keep you upright. Instead of standing upright being this neutral thing where you aren’t doing much, your body has adapted to form this new normal or new equilibrium set point where you’re constantly working on one side. 

And if we take this analogy back to the stress response, chronic stress leads to changes like that in your HPA axis, it becomes dysregulated because it’s had to adapt to this new normal. SO, you get a bunch of things including this consistently elevated cortisol, and that leads to your body becoming resistant to some hormones. And all this means that the threshold for acting and responding to change gets messed up and shifted. This can also lead to chronic inflammation in the body and even what we call epigenetic changes, which is where your experiences alter your gene expression or whether certain genes are turned on or off. 

These epigenetic changes happen in chronic stress, particularly with the genes that control how sensitive you are to some of these stress hormones. But, much like the analogy with bulking up your muscles, for this adaptation to happen and lead to those unhelpful outcomes, the stress would really need to be ongoing. Like, you aren’t going to suddenly grow one massive bicep from pushing back once. 



Thanks for watching! Today we’ve talked about the stress response and how this balancing act can lead to helpful and unhelpful consequences and we also talked about how two factors can influence that impact, namely intensity of the stressor and its chronicity. In our very last lecture together we’re going to talk about what determines whether a stress is a help or a hinderance. Tune in for the final time for Cognitive appraisals and mindsets.



### Lecture 2

How do you feel about stress? Is it bad, good, helpful, catastrophic? How well do you feel you cope with stress? In our final lecture together, we’re going to take a deep dive into our beliefs about stress and how they affect how we respond to stressful situations.

Let’s do this thing!!!

Ok so one appraisal model we’ll talk about is the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat. So, this theory applies to situations of motivated performance, and it’s an appraisal about the specific situation that we are in, not just our general beliefs. So, the model applies to things like, our upcoming exam for this course. 

According to this model, with motivated performance situations we make appraisals about both the **demands of the task**, so thinking about stuff like how hard or easy it will be, and we also think about our **personal resources to cope**. This would include thoughts like how prepared we are and our beliefs about how we usually do in exams. 



Depending on how those two sets of appraisals balance out, we can respond with either a **challenge state** where we view the situation as a challenge that we totes have the resources to meet and cope with, or we view the situation as a **threat** that we don’t have the resources to deal with. And, depending on which state we evoke, this can have a big impact on our stress response. So, the challenge state has been argued to be a more helpful response, and it actually has a different physiological response profile to threat. 

In a challenge state, the SAM system increases our heart rate and blood flow. The challenge state also allows for what’s known as more **responsive reactivity**. This essentially means that the stress response switches on an off more rapidly in this state, so it allows for a faster return to homeostasis once the challenge is dealt with. 



In contrast, the threat state activates not only SAM but also the HPA axis. This concurrent activation of the HPA axis has a really unusual effect; it actually dampens the SAM response a bit in terms of cardiac output, so you see very little change in heart rate. You also get a much more long-lasting stress response because of that cortisol that hangs around in the bloodstream. 



Now let’s keep in mind that we’re talking about performance situations, yeah? So, how does all this affect our core area of interest, performance? Well, as you may have guessed, the challenge state has been associated with better performance than the threat state. And this has been demonstrated in a range of studies from generic skills like attentional control and motor skill performance, to more specific things like athletic performance in sport or even university performance. 

Actually, in one particular study, uni students were asked to give a speech in the lab at the start of term, while their cardiac responses were measured. Students who showed a cardiac profile consistent with a challenge state during the speech actually showed significantly higher grades at the end of the term. And this was even after controlling for their previous academic performance, so it wasn’t just that high achievers were calmer in their speech.

Now, the interesting thing is that researchers have actually worked out a way to effectively change people’s stress state and encourage appraisals consistent with a challenge state. One way that this has been done has been to get people to reappraise their physiological arousal as an extra resource. Hey, it’s just your body preparing and getting ready to face the situation. Notice that this is NOT the same as trying to dampen or get rid of that arousal, in fact it’s a bit of the opposite, you are encouraging it as an adaptive preparatory resource that will benefit you. What the researchers found was that participants who received these instructions actually scored better on their maths test later on. Another study found similar results; reappraising stress as a resource led not only to superior exam performance but also less evaluation anxiety.



So, putting this all together we have learned that viewing stress as a beneficial resource can help bolster your chances of entering a challenge state where stress is helpful, not a hinderance. 



Another factor that can influence whether stress leads to helpful consequences is your general beliefs about stress. So, similar to the schemas we’ve spoken about previously, we all have general beliefs or mindsets about various domains, including our personality, intelligence, and psychological resources. You might have heard about **fixed mindset vs growth mindset.** Growth mindset is where you believe that people can develop and grow over time, your abilities can be improved incrementally. On the other hand, a fixed mindset is where you believe that a person’s ability or personality is fixed and unable to change. 

Research has shown that these mindsets influence our motivation and behavior. Holding a growth mindset encourages people to seek challenges and actually leads to improved performance in a range of domains including academic performance. 



Another factor that can influence whether stress leads to helpful consequences is your general beliefs about stress. Researchers have found that you can have a “stress-as-enhancing” mindset where you view stress as a useful tool, similar to that experiment we spoke about earlier. Alternatively, you may have a “stress-is-debilitating” mindset where you view stress unhelpful and something that will get in the way.  

Researchers have looked at the impact of these mindsets, and in correlational studies they’ve found some interesting things. So, in one study of finance employees they found that people with the enhancing mindset had greater life satisfaction, fewer anxiety and depression symptoms, and higher dispositional resources such as optimism, resilience, and mindfulness. And then when they looked at uni students, those who held the enhancing mindset showed more moderate cortisol reactivity and greater desire for feedback from peer and professor evaluators.

Now, fortunately, mindset is again something that can be changed. Initially the researchers used bias to paint a biased picture of stress, They took all the evidence about the good and bad consequences and made some videos that highlighted just the good or just the bad.  We can take a look/ or you can take a look here….

Now, these were shown to be effective in the short term, employees who watched these did self-report improved work performance and general health

But, seriously, the ethics of skewing the truth like this is a bit questionable. And what’s more, the effects haven’t been shown to be enduring so it’s not even like the dodgy means justify the end.

Thankfully, the researchers developed more sophisticated interventions that they delivered either in 2-hour face to face sessions or as a series of online modules. These were more complex and truthful, presenting more balanced information on both the enhancing and debilitating effects of stress, while also teaching about the role of mindset and the impact of stress-as-enhancing mindset. 

So, what did they find? Well, finance employees who had the 2hr face-to-face training reported improvements in health and wellbeing 3-4 weeks later (Crum, Santoro, Smith, Salovey, Achor, & Mooraveji, 2018). What’s more uni students who worked through the online modules just before they enrolled reported higher levels of positive affect during exams over their first and second years at uni (Goyer, Akinola, Grunberg, & Crum 2018). How cool is that?!



So, what’s the take home message? Firstly, during performance tasks like exams, minimise unnecessary external demands – do you really need to volunteer at the nursing home’s bake sale in the middle of exam week? Also try to increase your internal resources where you can. Things like hunger, thirst, exhaustion and loneliness will all decrease the resources you have available. So, make sure you look after yourself during times of stress. Eat nutritious foods, drink water, get adequate amounts of sleep and seek out some social support!

Also think about the role of mindset! Remember our chat about the Yerkes-Dodson curve and its impact on explicit memory and learning, some stress can be helpful and actually improve learning! Stress is not something that is inherently bad or scary. We don’t need to run from challenges. Control the things that we can control, try to let go of the things we can’t and embrace the challenges that life throws our way.



Thank you so much for being part of this course. It’s been such a joy going on this journey with you. Ann and I have had an absolute blast teaching you all. Take care, be kind to each other and go rock your goals for the future. I wish you all the best.
