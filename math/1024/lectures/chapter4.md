### Transcript

You’re sitting on your couch on a Sunday night, watching your favourite cheesy movie for the ten thousandth time and then… it gets to the intense bit. The hero reunites with the long-lost friend; they run through the street in the rain and embrace each other in the biggest, squishiest, squeeziest hug with tears rolling down their faces. 



And right at that moment, it gets you in the feels... You get that lump in your throat, you sniff and quickly wipe away a tear before your roommate sees your crying at cartoons – again - and you have to lie – again - saying, “I’ve just got something in my eye!” again.



Why does this happen every time? All the emotions, every time. What is the point of them? Why do we feel emotions? How do we feel emotions? And why do emotions make us think, behave and feel all the weird, wonderful - and not so wonderful - things we do?



Don’t worry! Science is here to help! Let’s take at look at Theories of Emotion.







You’ll remember last week I explained that scientific theories aren’t just a guess or a hunch. Scientific theories are a detailed account of why and how phenomena occur. And yeah, as inconvenient as emotions sometimes are, there is a why. Emotions serve a purpose. Actually, they serve lots of purposes!



Scientists who study emotions often emphasise a slightly different purpose and slightly different components of emotions. Today we’re going to talk about some of the prominent theories of emotion that join these components together. We’ll also outline their accounts of both the causes and impacts of emotions. You’ll see that each theory will emphasise the components of emotion in different ways and will give different accounts of how these components fit together.



Today we’re going to take a look at four groups of emotion theories:

The theories that emphasise the functional or evolutionary purpose of emotions

The theories that emphasise the motivational role of emotions

Theories that emphasise the role that our cognitive appraisal of the situation plays

And finally, some Constructivist theories that emphasise the way our sensory and physiological systems interact and learn about the environment.



Just keep in mind that, for some of these groups, there might be a whole bunch of researchers who propose slightly different variations of that theory. It's not like there’s only four different theories of emotion! This is just an introduction or taster; it’s definitely not a comprehensive account of all the theories of emotion.



If you think back to our discussions on the components of emotions, you’ll see that the theories in each of these groups emphasise slightly different components. Some place more emphasis on the behaviours of emotions, others emphasise the role of cognitions and others will emphasise the role of our bodies’ physiological responses.







Functional/Evolutionary theories



So, first up we have functional or evolutionary theories of emotion. At a really basic level, all the theories in this camp argue that the purpose of emotions is to help us quickly and effectively deal with a problem or take advantage of an opportunity in the environment. The researchers from this camp explain that, when we encounter a potentially problematic or advantageous situation, the stimuli in that environment triggers a cascade of changes in our physiology, our behaviour, our conscious experience and also the way we communicate. And all of those changes help us respond to the situation in a way that maximises our chances of surviving and thriving. Evolutionary scientists call this reacting in an adaptive way.



A really important part of this emotional response is our thoughts or cognitions. The purpose of those emotional cognitions is to interrupt our previous thoughts and behaviours because, if something like a threat has suddenly appeared, those old thoughts and behaviours are now completely inappropriate! 



And so, supporters of evolutionary theories argue that the purpose of emotions, and in particular those emotional cognitions, is to redirect our attention, our memory, and our judgement towards the stimulus that triggered the emotion so that we can survive.







Motivational theories



Theories of motivation go deeper into this idea. They propose that motivational intensity plays a big role in driving evolutionarily important outcomes. 

 

You’ll remember last time we briefly spoke about the motivational dimension of emotion [image from previous lecture]; this is the tendency to approach a stimulus or avoid a stimulus. Emotions like desire and anger are high in approach motivation whereas, fear and disgust are high in avoid motivation because, a lot of the time, we back away from things that make us afraid, or things that are just plain gross.

 

Remember that these two opposing motivational systems don’t just affect our behaviour. As we saw last time in the “forest for the trees chocolate experiment”, the intensity of the motivational affects which stimuli we focus on in the environment and also our cognitive scope. 



This was a pretty complex experiment so it’s worth taking another look at.



Remember that the researchers showed participants two different types of pictures. One set of pictures were low in motivational intensity; things like rocks. People don’t usually show a strong tendency to either approach or avoid things like rocks, so we know that rocks are low in motivational intensity. The other set of pictures were high in approach motivation. These were pictures of things like chocolate and other wonderful things that people are usually motivated to move towards. 



Now, after seeing either the boring rock or the delicious chocolate, the participants were then shown a Navon Figure. Remember those big letters made up of the tiny little letters? 



What the researchers found was that, after being shown the chocolate images high in approach motivation, participants were more likely to narrow their cognitive scope and focus on the tiny letters. On the other hand, if they’d just seen a picture with low motivation, like a rock, participants were more likely to have a broad cognitive scope and see the big letter.



And it turns out that this relationship between cognitive scope and motivational intensity also carries over to unpleasant emotions with avoidance motivation too. In another experiment, the researchers used images to promote negative emotions with lower motivation, like sadness. They contrasted this against images that provoked a high level of withdrawal; they used disgusting images to do that! These aren’t the exact images they used; I've just used them to illustrate the point.



So, what did they find? Well, similar to the chocolate version of this experiment with positive approach emotions, the researchers found that the same findings applied to negative emotions that varied in avoidance motivation. The level of motivational intensity determined whether the participants saw the little letters or the big letters. Just like in the approach version, when the person felt an emotion with a lower level of avoidance motivational intensity, like sadness, they were more likely to see the big letters. Emotions lower in motivational intensity broadened their cognitive scope [animation]. On the other hand, when the participants felt emotions higher in withdraw motivation, like disgust, they focused on the little letters. Emotions high in motivational intensity narrowed participants’ cognitive scope.



And so, the factor that determines which level of the perceptual hierarchy we focus on really seems to be the intensity of the emotion not factors like valence or motivational direction.



By now you might be thinking like a good scientist and asking more questions; ok, sweet, but why would this happen? What possible purpose could this effect serve? Why would it be adaptive to change our cognitive scope in response to the intensity of our emotions?



Well, the authors explained that low motivation emotions, like satisfaction or sadness, might be best served by stepping back and looking at the bigger picture. By prompting these exploratory types of thoughts and emotions, it might help us to consider new opportunities or to disengage from goals we can’t achieve. On the other hand, a narrow cognitive scope resulting from high motivation emotions might make our goals more attainable. And this makes sense regardless of whether that goal was to approach or avoid. Put another way, by narrowing in and focusing on a target, you’re less likely to have distractions get in the way of achieving your goal, irrespective of whether your goal was to get the stimulus or get away from it!





Appraisal theories



Just as the name suggests, appraisal theories really emphasise the role that cognitions play in emotions. Just like all the other groups of theories, there are a few different versions of appraisal theory. Most of them view emotions and cognitions as distinct but related categories of experience. The brain circuits of emotions and cognitions seem to be separate too but that’s all well beyond the scope of this course! This relates to our phenomenology or subjective experience that it feels like they are quite different.



In a nutshell, cognitive appraisal is our evaluation of something. If we hear a sound, what do we make of it? Researchers who support this theory recognise that cognitive appraisal of a situation can cause our emotions and also be caused by our emotions. So, a causal appraisal theory might argue that a kid lying in bed hears a noise outside and then they evaluate that stimulus as something scary. They appraise that sound as a threat. In turn, this appraisal of threat triggers a fear response in the kid’s body; those things like the heart racing and the urge to run. 



Other researchers have modified and extended this theory. Remember that scientific theories aren’t set in stone. They get modified and updated as more evidence comes to hand. So, these other researchers have argued that, yeah, our appraisals can influence which emotion we’re feeling but cognitions can also regulate and modify our emotions once they’re activated. So, the kid in bed is scared but might then think, “Oh, actually, maybe it was just the cat,” and then feel better. 



And so, you can see how our emotional cognitions serve a purpose by helping us to consider and evaluate different possibilities about the stimulus.



Constructionist theories



In contrast to appraisal theories, which see emotion as something that happens separately after cognition, constructionist accounts view emotion as a complex and dynamic state that the brain constructs and cognitions are included as part of that state. Essentially, constructionist accounts argue that emotion isn’t something separate that follows on from cognition. Instead, they argue that our cognitions, behaviours and physiology are all part of this one state or experience.



Again, complex idea so let me explain.



The kid lying in bed receives exteroceptive input from the outside world through our senses. This would obviously be the creaking floorboard sound that their ears heard, but also more subtle stimuli such as the darkness of the room, which humans find an inherently scary thing. 



Alongside the exteroceptive information, the brain also takes note of proprioceptive information. Proprioception has to do with the movement and placement of your body in space. So, the child might recognise that they’re lying flat and they’re not moving.



Finally, the brain also takes note of interoceptive information. These are things from inside the body, like noticing fluctuations in heart rate and breathing, as well as any sensations in your tummy.

So, what does the brain do with all that information? In order to know which emotion we should be feeling and what to do about that emotion, the brain has to decipher what caused those internal and external changes and also what they mean. Does all this sensory information mean I’m about to get eaten by a monster or does it mean that I should go back to sleep? 



Well, the constructivist theories argue that the brain constructs our emotions by comparing that full sensory array from all those inputs to the sensory arrays that we’ve experienced in the past. Most importantly, the brain also considers the consequences of those past experiences. The consequences of previous situations tell us really important things like, “Was that experience dangerous?”



So, last time I felt like this and it was dark, and I was laying still in bed and I heard the floorboards creak and there were butterflies in my tummy, did a monster really jump out or was everything ok? You can see in this example that the brain uses all that sensory information, as well as the consequence of previous situations, to work out 1) what is most likely to have caused all that sensory input? and 2) based on what I did previously, what behaviours should I now perform in response to this situation?



This whole process is actually a bit like the scientific method. The evaluation isn’t something static that happens once, and then we move on. Just like science, learning about all this emotional information is an iterative process that keeps updating according to the most current information that we have.



Now, just like in science, sometimes our brains get it wrong. A prediction will be made and it turns out to be wrong. This is known as prediction error and it’s actually an integral part of learning, as we’ll see later on in the course!



Thanks for watching!
