## The science of emotions

Emotions vs moods

* Emotions are shorter in duration, more specific, and tend to occur in response to a stimulus/cue
* Moods can last days to months, and not have a specific cause.
* Moods can be harder to pinpoint than emotions, they are more diffuse/vague



Affect: an umbrella term used to refer to clusters of experiences (mood, emotions, and feelings, and their valence)

* valence: the positive/negativeness of the emotion/mood/feeling/etc



Six universal emotions

* Joy or happiness
* Sadness
* Surprise
* Anger
* Fear, and
* Disgust



Emotions are made up of

* a response to some sort of trigger or stimulus
* cognition – so, the those thoughts that ran through your head e.g. “it’s not fair” 
* physiology – e.g. bodily changes
* behaviour - particular expression on your face, stand in a certain way or even yell
* conscious experiences - this refers to the things that you are aware of amidst all this, contextual cues, smells, the environment around you; all the things you are consciously aware of.



## Classifying emotions - discrete vs dimensional

Discrete emotions: 

Dimensional emotions: 

One approach is to identify discrete emotions that are distinct and separate from one another. In general, these approaches argue that emotions should be considered distinct categories that are naturally delineated.

Not all species exhibit the six universal emotions of discrete emotion theory

Dimensional emotion theory: Dimensional accounts of emotion argue that, instead of being entirely distinct categories, emotions exist along spectrums or dimensions.

	* valence, which varies from positive to negative
	* hysiological arousal, which varies from high to low
	* and

 * motivation, varying from approach to avoidance
   * approach/avoid motivational system is present in all animals from earthworms to pigeons, rats to humans.

Theories that emphasise the role that our cognitive appraisal of the situation plays

### Transcript

You’re sitting on your couch on a Sunday night, watching your favourite cheesy movie for the ten thousandth time and then… it gets to the intense bit. The hero reunites with the long-lost friend; they run through the street in the rain and embrace each other in the biggest, squishiest, squeeziest hug with tears rolling down their faces. 



And right at that moment, it gets you in the feels... You get that lump in your throat, you sniff and quickly wipe away a tear before your roommate sees your crying at cartoons – again - and you have to lie – again - saying, “I’ve just got something in my eye!” again.



Why does this happen every time? All the emotions, every time. What is the point of them? Why do we feel emotions? How do we feel emotions? And why do emotions make us think, behave and feel all the weird, wonderful - and not so wonderful - things we do?



Don’t worry! Science is here to help! Let’s take at look at Theories of Emotion.







You’ll remember last week I explained that scientific theories aren’t just a guess or a hunch. Scientific theories are a detailed account of why and how phenomena occur. And yeah, as inconvenient as emotions sometimes are, there is a why. Emotions serve a purpose. Actually, they serve lots of purposes!



Scientists who study emotions often emphasise a slightly different purpose and slightly different components of emotions. Today we’re going to talk about some of the prominent theories of emotion that join these components together. We’ll also outline their accounts of both the causes and impacts of emotions. You’ll see that each theory will emphasise the components of emotion in different ways and will give different accounts of how these components fit together.



Today we’re going to take a look at four groups of emotion theories:

The theories that emphasise the functional or evolutionary purpose of emotions

The theories that emphasise the motivational role of emotions

Theories that emphasise the role that our cognitive appraisal of the situation plays

And finally, some Constructivist theories that emphasise the way our sensory and physiological systems interact and learn about the environment.



Just keep in mind that, for some of these groups, there might be a whole bunch of researchers who propose slightly different variations of that theory. It's not like there’s only four different theories of emotion! This is just an introduction or taster; it’s definitely not a comprehensive account of all the theories of emotion.



If you think back to our discussions on the components of emotions, you’ll see that the theories in each of these groups emphasise slightly different components. Some place more emphasis on the behaviours of emotions, others emphasise the role of cognitions and others will emphasise the role of our bodies’ physiological responses.







Functional/Evolutionary theories



So, first up we have functional or evolutionary theories of emotion. At a really basic level, all the theories in this camp argue that the purpose of emotions is to help us quickly and effectively deal with a problem or take advantage of an opportunity in the environment. The researchers from this camp explain that, when we encounter a potentially problematic or advantageous situation, the stimuli in that environment triggers a cascade of changes in our physiology, our behaviour, our conscious experience and also the way we communicate. And all of those changes help us respond to the situation in a way that maximises our chances of surviving and thriving. Evolutionary scientists call this reacting in an adaptive way.



A really important part of this emotional response is our thoughts or cognitions. The purpose of those emotional cognitions is to interrupt our previous thoughts and behaviours because, if something like a threat has suddenly appeared, those old thoughts and behaviours are now completely inappropriate! 



And so, supporters of evolutionary theories argue that the purpose of emotions, and in particular those emotional cognitions, is to redirect our attention, our memory, and our judgement towards the stimulus that triggered the emotion so that we can survive.







Motivational theories



Theories of motivation go deeper into this idea. They propose that motivational intensity plays a big role in driving evolutionarily important outcomes. 

 

You’ll remember last time we briefly spoke about the motivational dimension of emotion [image from previous lecture]; this is the tendency to approach a stimulus or avoid a stimulus. Emotions like desire and anger are high in approach motivation whereas, fear and disgust are high in avoid motivation because, a lot of the time, we back away from things that make us afraid, or things that are just plain gross.

 

Remember that these two opposing motivational systems don’t just affect our behaviour. As we saw last time in the “forest for the trees chocolate experiment”, the intensity of the motivational affects which stimuli we focus on in the environment and also our cognitive scope. 



This was a pretty complex experiment so it’s worth taking another look at.



Remember that the researchers showed participants two different types of pictures. One set of pictures were low in motivational intensity; things like rocks. People don’t usually show a strong tendency to either approach or avoid things like rocks, so we know that rocks are low in motivational intensity. The other set of pictures were high in approach motivation. These were pictures of things like chocolate and other wonderful things that people are usually motivated to move towards. 



Now, after seeing either the boring rock or the delicious chocolate, the participants were then shown a Navon Figure. Remember those big letters made up of the tiny little letters? 



What the researchers found was that, after being shown the chocolate images high in approach motivation, participants were more likely to narrow their cognitive scope and focus on the tiny letters. On the other hand, if they’d just seen a picture with low motivation, like a rock, participants were more likely to have a broad cognitive scope and see the big letter.



And it turns out that this relationship between cognitive scope and motivational intensity also carries over to unpleasant emotions with avoidance motivation too. In another experiment, the researchers used images to promote negative emotions with lower motivation, like sadness. They contrasted this against images that provoked a high level of withdrawal; they used disgusting images to do that! These aren’t the exact images they used; I've just used them to illustrate the point.



So, what did they find? Well, similar to the chocolate version of this experiment with positive approach emotions, the researchers found that the same findings applied to negative emotions that varied in avoidance motivation. The level of motivational intensity determined whether the participants saw the little letters or the big letters. Just like in the approach version, when the person felt an emotion with a lower level of avoidance motivational intensity, like sadness, they were more likely to see the big letters. Emotions lower in motivational intensity broadened their cognitive scope [animation]. On the other hand, when the participants felt emotions higher in withdraw motivation, like disgust, they focused on the little letters. Emotions high in motivational intensity narrowed participants’ cognitive scope.



And so, the factor that determines which level of the perceptual hierarchy we focus on really seems to be the intensity of the emotion not factors like valence or motivational direction.



By now you might be thinking like a good scientist and asking more questions; ok, sweet, but why would this happen? What possible purpose could this effect serve? Why would it be adaptive to change our cognitive scope in response to the intensity of our emotions?



Well, the authors explained that low motivation emotions, like satisfaction or sadness, might be best served by stepping back and looking at the bigger picture. By prompting these exploratory types of thoughts and emotions, it might help us to consider new opportunities or to disengage from goals we can’t achieve. On the other hand, a narrow cognitive scope resulting from high motivation emotions might make our goals more attainable. And this makes sense regardless of whether that goal was to approach or avoid. Put another way, by narrowing in and focusing on a target, you’re less likely to have distractions get in the way of achieving your goal, irrespective of whether your goal was to get the stimulus or get away from it!





Appraisal theories



Just as the name suggests, appraisal theories really emphasise the role that cognitions play in emotions. Just like all the other groups of theories, there are a few different versions of appraisal theory. Most of them view emotions and cognitions as distinct but related categories of experience. The brain circuits of emotions and cognitions seem to be separate too but that’s all well beyond the scope of this course! This relates to our phenomenology or subjective experience that it feels like they are quite different.



In a nutshell, cognitive appraisal is our evaluation of something. If we hear a sound, what do we make of it? Researchers who support this theory recognise that cognitive appraisal of a situation can cause our emotions and also be caused by our emotions. So, a causal appraisal theory might argue that a kid lying in bed hears a noise outside and then they evaluate that stimulus as something scary. They appraise that sound as a threat. In turn, this appraisal of threat triggers a fear response in the kid’s body; those things like the heart racing and the urge to run. 



Other researchers have modified and extended this theory. Remember that scientific theories aren’t set in stone. They get modified and updated as more evidence comes to hand. So, these other researchers have argued that, yeah, our appraisals can influence which emotion we’re feeling but cognitions can also regulate and modify our emotions once they’re activated. So, the kid in bed is scared but might then think, “Oh, actually, maybe it was just the cat,” and then feel better. 



And so, you can see how our emotional cognitions serve a purpose by helping us to consider and evaluate different possibilities about the stimulus.



Constructionist theories



In contrast to appraisal theories, which see emotion as something that happens separately after cognition, constructionist accounts view emotion as a complex and dynamic state that the brain constructs and cognitions are included as part of that state. Essentially, constructionist accounts argue that emotion isn’t something separate that follows on from cognition. Instead, they argue that our cognitions, behaviours and physiology are all part of this one state or experience.



Again, complex idea so let me explain.



The kid lying in bed receives exteroceptive input from the outside world through our senses. This would obviously be the creaking floorboard sound that their ears heard, but also more subtle stimuli such as the darkness of the room, which humans find an inherently scary thing. 



Alongside the exteroceptive information, the brain also takes note of proprioceptive information. Proprioception has to do with the movement and placement of your body in space. So, the child might recognise that they’re lying flat and they’re not moving.



Finally, the brain also takes note of interoceptive information. These are things from inside the body, like noticing fluctuations in heart rate and breathing, as well as any sensations in your tummy.

So, what does the brain do with all that information? In order to know which emotion we should be feeling and what to do about that emotion, the brain has to decipher what caused those internal and external changes and also what they mean. Does all this sensory information mean I’m about to get eaten by a monster or does it mean that I should go back to sleep? 



Well, the constructivist theories argue that the brain constructs our emotions by comparing that full sensory array from all those inputs to the sensory arrays that we’ve experienced in the past. Most importantly, the brain also considers the consequences of those past experiences. The consequences of previous situations tell us really important things like, “Was that experience dangerous?”



So, last time I felt like this and it was dark, and I was laying still in bed and I heard the floorboards creak and there were butterflies in my tummy, did a monster really jump out or was everything ok? You can see in this example that the brain uses all that sensory information, as well as the consequence of previous situations, to work out 1) what is most likely to have caused all that sensory input? and 2) based on what I did previously, what behaviours should I now perform in response to this situation?



This whole process is actually a bit like the scientific method. The evaluation isn’t something static that happens once, and then we move on. Just like science, learning about all this emotional information is an iterative process that keeps updating according to the most current information that we have.



Now, just like in science, sometimes our brains get it wrong. A prediction will be made and it turns out to be wrong. This is known as prediction error and it’s actually an integral part of learning, as we’ll see later on in the course!



### Transcript

What is an emotion? Intuitively you’d think that this would be easy to define. Everyone knows what emotions are. They’re our feelings, right? Mmm... maybe. But then what’s a feeling? It’s er... what we feel, like, our emotions. 

Not very scientific, hey?

Defining what an emotion is, is really tricky. And so, it’s probably not surprising that scientists can’t agree on a definition either! Truly, there is no single, widely accepted definition of what an emotion is or what causes emotions. 

As you probably gathered from last week’s lecture on the scientific method, researchers disagree a lot and so many emotion researchers have slightly different definitions. They do agree on some aspects though, so let’s start there.

Most researchers can agree on what emotions are not. Although in conversation we might use words like feelings, emotions, moods, or affect interchangeably, for scientists, these terms are not the same thing.

Most scientists agree that emotions are shorter in duration than moods and emotions also tend to have an “aboutness”. What this means is that is emotions tend to occur in response to some sort of stimulus or cue; they tend to be more specific than moods. 

For example, that kid Johnny in the playground stole your ice cream. You immediately feel angry; you’re hot and tense and your heart is pounding. Your emotion is about the event that happened to you. A little bit later you notice you’re feeling better because you're playing with some other kids who are nice to you. You can see that in this scenario, your emotions changed from anger to happy in a pretty short space of time and in response to specific events.

Moods on the other hand, can last anywhere from days to months, and they don’t have that same aboutness that emotions do. You might just wake up one day and feel a bit low, without any specific stimulus or event that caused it. 

Moods are also more diffuse than emotions; they’re a bit more vague. Whereas we can often specify our emotions - “I feel angry” - moods can be a bit harder to pinpoint. 

Finally, we have affect and this is broader still. Affect is a broad umbrella term that can be used to refer to clusters of experiences, including mood, emotions and feelings, as well as the valence of these thing. Valence simply refers to the “positiveness” or “negativeness”. So, a “good” mood versus a “bad” mood.





Now, because we’re all human beings and we’ve all felt emotions, surely that gives us at least some insight into what emotions are and how they should be defined. Right? So, let’s consider our own experiences of emotions and we can see how these ideas match up to scientists’ ideas a bit later.



Take a moment to think about some emotions that you’ve felt. Can you name them? Take a moment to list some emotions.





How did you go? 

Some scientists have described emotions in terms of primary emotions and secondary emotions. The primary emotions are sometimes referred to as the “6 universal emotions” because virtually every culture on the planet recognises them. If you ever saw the movie Inside/Out then these might be familiar to you:

Joy or happiness

Sadness

Surprise

Anger

Fear and

Disgust

Other emotions you may have listed might be considered secondary emotions or even culture-specific emotions. Some of these types of emotions include embarrassment, guilt, resentment, apprehension and the culturally specific emotion schadenfreude, the German term for when a person feels pleasure at someone else’s misfortune.

So, we’ve all felt emotions but how do we know when we’re experiencing a specific emotion? What are the components that make up that emotion? Let’s look at an example and then see if we can come up with some ideas.

Now, imagine you’re 5 years old and your teenage sister is baby-sitting you at home while your parents are out. Your sister makes for herself the most delicious double scoop choc fudge ice cream sundae with chocolate sauce and marshmallows and sprinkles. The works. 

You’re waiting patiently. Waiting. Waiting... and then you politely ask, “Can I have one too?” Your sister glances over and says in a condescending voice, “Oh what a shame, I’ve just finished all the choc fudge ice cream, and there’s no more chocolate sauce or marshmallows or anything either. But there might be like half a scoop of vanilla left in the freezer." So, she scrapes the last icy, freezer-burnt scraps of the boring vanilla into a bowl, slides it across the table, blinks at you and says “Here”.

How might you feel in this situation? 

Angry, right?! 

Ok, so let’s take a look at what components made up that emotion - anger. 

What happened just before you got angry? There’s some sort of event or stimulus that triggers your anger. Just like other emotions, anger has “aboutness” - we don’t just feel emotions for no reason, we feel anger about something. Often, it’s when we’ve been wronged by someone or feel a sense of injustice.

What thoughts might have run through your head when you were angry? In psychology, we call thoughts cognitions. Some of the cognitions that might have gone through your head are “That’s wrong!” or “It’s not fair!”

Now, what clues in your body might tell you that you’re angry? The physiological changes that happen in our body can sometimes give us an indication that we’re feeling a particular emotion. When you’re angry, you might feel your heart racing, your palms might get sweaty, your cheeks might flush.

And now that you’re angry, what might you do? What behaviours does anger provoke? Someone who’s angry might pull a face like this [image] or they might stand like this [image]. When you’ve been angry, did you raise your voice? Some people might even get aggressive or violent when they’re angry.



Ok, so this is our folk theory definition of anger; we’d say that emotions are made up of:

A stimulus

Cognitions

Physiological symptoms and

Behaviours.

How does our folk theory definition compare a scientists’ definition of emotion?



Well, it turns out that these components come up in lots of different scientific theories of emotion. They don’t feature in all theories of emotion but when you look at lots of theories collectively, these are the components they all seem to cover.

In a recent commentary paper about measuring emotion, researcher Peter Kuppens wrote that emotions involve:

A response to some sort of trigger or stimulus - just like in our example when your emotion was in response to your sister’s actions

Cognition – so, the those thoughts that ran through your head e.g. “it’s not fair” 

Physiology – think about those bodily changes we spoke about like your heart racing or your cheeks turning red

Behaviour - so you might show a particular expression on your face, you might stand in a certain way or even yell

And conscious experiences - this refers to the things that you are aware of amidst all this, contextual cues, smells, the environment around you; all the things you are consciously aware of.

Now, like I said, not all theories will look at all of these components together, and they certainly won’t look at them in the same way. Some theories might focus on just one aspect and another theory might focus on something different. But the important part to remember is that when you look at the theories in the literature collectively, as a whole, these are the components that those theories all seem to cover.





Thanks for watching! In this lecture we covered what emotions are, what they’re not, we defined mood and affect, and we looked at the components that make up our different emotions. 

In the next lecture we’ll take a closer look at emotions and talk about how different emotions affect our body. We’ll look at how our body and brain uses these components to work out which particular emotion we’re feeling at any given time.



### Transcript

In our last lecture we spoke a bit about the different components of emotions. Just like the scientific theories of emotion, we decided that the main components are:

a stimulus that cues the onset of the emotion

thoughts or cognitions

physiological symptoms like a change in heart rate

and behaviours that are associated with that particular emotion.

But how do our body and mind tell the difference between different emotions? How do we know when we’re are angry versus when we’re afraid? 

Do we just know because the feelings are sooo different or is there some overlap in the components of different emotions?

Let’s compare the components of two different emotions, anger and fear, and see if we can work out how our bodies and minds might do this.

 

So, in the last lecture we already decided that some of the components of anger were:

An event that we interpreted as wrong, unfair or unjust

Thoughts related to the situation and being wronged, and lastly 

Physiological symptoms like our heart racing and our palms getting sweaty

Behaviours such as standing in a particular way or approaching the person who committed the act that we interpreted as unjust.

So, what about fear? Are the components of fear different and are there any situations where the components of anger and fear might be similar?

Event For some people, events that trigger anger might be very different than events that trigger fear. But it’s also not hard to imagine a situation that could trigger either or even both of these emotions! 

If a person witnessed a drunken stranger staggering around and screaming racist abuse at no one in particular, the person might feel angry that someone would say such awful words, but they may also be simultaneously afraid of what this person might do next.

Physiology A person witnessing this situation might start sweating, their heart might start racing. If you looked closely you might notice their pupils dilating. 

But if you only had those pieces of information – sweating, racing heart and dilated pupils – what emotion would you say that person is feeling? Anger? Fear? Love?!

Thoughts Let’s see if our thoughts are better at helping us work out which particular emotion we’re feeling. 

Sometimes the content of our thoughts helps us out a great deal; an angry person might think, “Oh, you horrible person! How dare you say that,” whereas a scared person might think, “Oh geez, just stay over there, don’t look at me, don’t look at me!”

But in a really tense situation it can sometimes be difficult to think clearly. A person's thoughts may be more along the lines of, “Gaaahh...”. Good luck deciphering which emotion a person is feeling from just that piece of information!

Behaviour When it comes to the behaviours that different emotions elicit these can usually give us helpful clues, for example the way that facial expressions do. Different emotions can also prompt even more obvious motivational behaviours like approaching the stimulus if we’re angry or avoiding the stimulus and backing away if we’re scared. 

But this doesn’t mean that we can always just use behaviour to work out which emotion people are feeling. Have you ever heard of "putting on a brave face"? Just because we’re feeling a certain emotion doesn’t necessarily mean we’re going to show the corresponding expression on our faces.

And this really drives home how important it is to consider all of the components together. When your body and mind decipher which emotion is being felt, it’s not a simple matter of just interpreting physiological reactions or just behaviours and then suddenly being able to work out which emotion is being felt. Interpreting emotions is a complicated process and certainly not as easy to do as people may intuitively think.

So, if it’s really difficult to decipher and categorise our emotions, then how do scientists do it? Well, there are a couple of main approaches. One approach is to identify discrete emotions that are distinct and separate from one another. In general, these approaches argue that emotions should be considered distinct categories that are naturally delineated.

Within each of those categories the experiences are similar. Importantly, they’re similar in ways that we can observe and measure. So, things that we can observe and measure might be behaviours like facial expressions or the physiological changes that happen in our bodies like our heart rate. Emotion researchers have observed that anger and fear tend to have different clusters of thoughts, behaviours and physiological responses. . And so, at its core, the discrete emotion approach argues that anger is a different category of emotion to fear. And both of those are different categories of experience to sadness, for example. 

This discreet approach to emotion also argues that each instance of anger – so, each of the different times the person was angry – that person’s thoughts, behaviours and physiological responses were pretty similar to each other.



Perhaps the most well-known proponent of the discreet emotion approach is Paul Ekman. Ekman spent decades travelling around the world to many different literate and non-literate cultures. His research found that you could show any one of these faces to pretty much anyone of any gender, from any culture around the world and the overwhelming majority of people from any culture would be able to correctly identify which emotion the person was feeling. And so, he argued that happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise and anger are Universal Basic Emotions that are fundamentally distinct from one another and occur across all cultures.

The striking thing about this basic emotion approach is that, even when researchers have used very different methods in their experiments, and even different species, they often “converge on many of the same basic emotions, despite having emerged from very different research traditions”. 

For example, Jaak Panksepp used electrodes to stimulate different brain areas in non-human animals; that is obviously very different form Ekman’s methods! But just like Ekman he still derived a list of basic emotions very similar to Ekman, including fear, rage and joy or play.

Because lots of different researchers have used lots of different research methods and found essentially the same thing, what that tells us is that the discreet approach does have scientific merit. But this doesn’t mean it’s perfect. 

One of the early criticisms is that not all animals exhibit the behaviours and physiological reactions that the discrete basic emotion approach would predict. Earthworms, for example, only show behaviours like approaching a stimulus or avoiding a stimulus. And so, other researchers argue a more evolutionarily ancient system is more accurate in explaining how we feel emotions and how our bodies tell the difference between them.

Dimensional accounts of emotion argue that, instead of being entirely distinct categories, emotions exist along spectrums or dimensions. The most common dimensions that scientists consider are valence, which varies from positive to negative, and physiological arousal, which varies from high to low. A number of researchers also talk about motivation, varying from approach to avoidance. And there’s good evidence that some form of approach/avoid motivational system is present in all animals from earthworms to pigeons, rats to humans. 

Dimensional accounts argue that these much more basal psychological processes can explain the emotional components that we’re observing. And this is a really important point, the principle of parsimony. In science, if there are two different theories that both explain the phenomena we’re observing then the theory that relies on simpler processes is more likely to be correct than the one that relies on complex processes. The exception to this rule is when both accounts seem to have some utility in different situations. We’ll come back to that point in a moment!



One of the most common dimensional models of emotion is the Circumplex Model of Affect which was proposed by James Russell in 1980. According to this account, emotions can be classified in terms of where they sit on the two dimensions of valence and arousal. 







Have a go at working out where the following emotions fall on these axes. 



How did you go? 





As you can see here, Russell mapped lots of emotions along these dimensions. So, both excited and relaxed might be roughly equivalent in terms of positivity but excited is going to be much higher in arousal than relaxed. Similarly, afraid and bored are similar in negativity, but afraid is higher in physiological arousal than bored.



Now, like so many debates in science - and pretty much every aspect of life - the Discreet and Dimensional approaches are generally pitted against one another and considered like an either/or situation. But maybe approaches have utility and value; maybe they’re not mutually exclusive. 

Eddie Harmon-Jones is one researcher who advocates for both approaches. He thinks that instead of arguing and trying to disprove the other theory, researchers should be looking at all of the evidence together and trying to come up with ways to integrate the strengths of both perspectives.





So, why should we consider both? Well, as Harmon-Jones argues, sometimes one classification system will be relevant and at other times the other system is more useful. 

For example, in one experiment when participants felt the emotion fear, the participants directed their attention towards threatening stimuli. On the other hand, participants who were made to feel neutral, excited or angry didn’t show that same tendency to focus on the threat. Those participants just looked around at other things.

And so, you can see that in some instances, a discrete emotion can cause specific, observable effects. So, even though it relies on more complex psychological processes, the discreet emotion account does have the power to explain and predict our emotional experiences in certain circumstances.



At other times, however, a dimensional approach might be more relevant. 

For example, there’s this phenomenon called cognitive scope. It’s essentially the hierarchical level that we analyse stimuli at. 

Super abstract idea but think of it as the concept behind that proverb “you can’t see the forest for the trees.” Sometimes, you’re analysing the world at such a fine level of detail that you can’t see the big picture.

Anyway, cognitive scope - whether we’re focusing on the fine detail or the big picture – that phenomenon is actually affected by our emotions. And there’s some good evidence that the motivational intensity of the emotion is what drives this effect. Let me explain... 

So, for a long time scientists thought it was all about valence - positive emotions narrowed our cognitive scope and negative emotions broadened or cognitive scope. They essentially thought that happy people were more likely to see tiny letters, the proverbial trees and sad people were more likely to see the bigger letter, the proverbial forest. 

But it turns out this isn’t quite right. Instead, motivational intensity, so the intensity to which the emotion compels us to approach or avoid the stimulus, that seems to be driving this effect not whether the emotion is positive or negative.

 

In 2008, Gable and Harmon-Jones showed participants either pictures high in approach motivation, pictures like chocolate and pictures low in motivational intensity, like pictures of rocks.

They found that after seeing a stimulus high in approach motivation, like chocolate, participants were more likely to have a narrowed cognitive scope and see the tiny figures, compared to being shown images with lower motivational intensity. 

And so, you can see that in this case, the dimensional approach is really valuable in this case because it accurately explains the phenomena that was observed.

And remember that that characteristic was one of the features of a good scientific theory; it should explain what we’re observing. Now that our understanding of the dimensional account has been updated, it can also help us to predict what will happen in the future, as we’ll see in the next lecture!
