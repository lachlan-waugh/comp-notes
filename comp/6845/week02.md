# Forensic method and ethics

## forensically sound
* digital evidence collected via standard, documented, proven forensic process
* admissible evidence must be **defensible** and **repeatable**

| defensible | process accepted as industry standard/proven to be sound/precedent |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| repeatable | process well-documented, 3rd-party could replicate results given same data |

&nbsp;

## principles of handling digital evidence 

1. all general forensic/procedural principle must be applied when handling digital evidence 
2. actions should be taken to not modify evidence 
3. anyone accessing evidence should be trained to do so 
4. document all activity related to seizure, access, storage and transfer of evidence

## Morals and ethics
| ethics | moral principles that govern a person's behaviour or the conducting of an activity  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| morals | standards of behaviour, principles of right/wrong. Emphasis on widely shared norms.  |

* ethics are generally defined by a relevant industry body, while morals are personal.
* decisions can be ethical but amoral: e.g. refusing to represent a terrorist, if everyone refused to represent them, and they had no representation, the case against them would be dropped.

### questions to help guide an ethical decision

* Would I be happy if this decision was on the front page of Sydney Morning Herald tomorrow?
* Is there an ethical non-negotiable at the heard of the decision ie, our duty as a human being, investigator, or expert?
* Will my actions impact the greater good?
* What would happen if everyone made the same decision?
* What will this do to my reputation/my employer's reputation?
* Is this consistent with my moral code?
