# the physical environment

Located at 33°51'54'' S, 151°12'34'' in the South-Eastern hemisphere



#### overview

* relatively isolated, large and flat
* geologically old and stable
* driest inhabited continent
* strange soils



this has caused

* high biological diversity
* high endemicity (species only occuring in Australia)
* biota  with unique adaptations to dry/variable climate
* unique structural formations, biotic and behavioural adaptations
* susceptibility to extinctions



elevation and relief

* large, but sparsely populated
* the flattest continent
* lowest average elevation (330m), lowest elevation, and absolute relief
* eastern seaboard is flanked by the great escarpment and the great dividing range



four main units

* Wianamatta group
  * Ashfield shale (older)
  * Bringelly shale (younger)
* Hawkesbury sandstone
  * soils very thin/low in nutrients
* Narrabeen group
* Permian coal measures



* lacking in fossils
* geology dominated by sedimentary undeformed rocks



landscape features controlled by geology

* rock types and structures
* weathering and erosion
* local climate patterns
* building resources
* limits of areas of occupation
* soils and fertility
* 



## climate and vegetation

Sydney basin is a physiographic region, a biogeographic region



#### australian climate

strongly controlled by:

* subtropical high pressure belt
* equatorial low pressure belt
* trade winds
* mid-latitude westerlies



sea-breeze/land-breeze cycle

east coast lows

Cba/cfa classification

uniform rainfall (1400 -> 700)

30 thunderstorms per year

prone to heat waves/drought



moist forests (sheltered hillsides/gullies)

dry woodlands (plateaux/ridges)

Dominated by Eucalyptus/Corymbia



six major vegetation communities

* sandstone: ridgetop woodland, gully forest, heaths
* shale: blue gum high forest, turpentine ironbark forest, cumberland plain woodland



major controls are geology (soils/nutrients) and rainfall

humans especially impacted shale-based communities



## coast and beaches

originally part of super-continent Gondwana, started to separate away 160 million years ago



Moved up to 7mm a year



Hawkesbury sandstone dominates coastline, responsible for drowned river valleys (estuaries), embayed beached, transport issues

70% of sydney is considered rocky



estuary: semi-enclosed body of water influenced by both fresh and salt water

* sydney harbour, broken bay, port hacking



ICOLLS - intermittently closed nad open lakes and lagoons (dee why and narraben)



south 1/2: microtidal wave-dominated (bigger waves, smaller tides)

north 1/2: tide modified/dominated with reefs (smaller waves, bigger tides)



* dissipative
* longshore bar trough
* rhythmic bar and beach
* transverse bar and rip
* low tide terrace
* reflective
