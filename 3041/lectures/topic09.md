Interacting populations
---

#### Population law of mass action

> The rate of change of one population due to the interaction with another is proportional to the product of the two populations



### No interaction

Two populations have no effect on each other

> $\Large\frac{dx}{dt}$$=R_1(x)$
>
> $\Large\frac{dy}{dt}$$=R_2(y)$



### Crowding

Overcrowding of a population

> $\Large\frac{dx}{dt}$$=\alpha x-ax^2$
>
> * $\alpha$ is the Maltuhsian growth rate
> * $a$ is the (positive) self-interaction proportionality constant due to crowding of pop. $x$



### Predator-prey

The most simple, positive for one species, negative for another

> $\Large\frac{dx}{dt}$$=-\alpha x+cxy$
>
> $\Large\frac{dy}{dt}$$=\beta y-dxy$
>
> * $x$ is the predator population, $y$ is the prey
> * $-\alpha x$ and $\beta y$ model natural decay and growth
> * $+cxy$: food promotes predator population
> * $-dxy$: food diminshes prey population growth rate



### Predator-prey with crowding

> $\Large\frac{dx}{dt}$$=-\alpha x -ax^2+cxy$
>
> $\Large\frac{dy}{dt}$$=\beta y -by^2 -dxy$



### Harvesting





### Cooperation





### Competition



### Satiation



## Vector form of a system of DEs

> $\begin{pmatrix}
> \Large\frac{dx}{dt} \\
> \Large\frac{dy}{dt}
> \end{pmatrix}
> =
> \begin{pmatrix}
> f(x,y) \\
> g(x,y)
> \end{pmatrix}$



### Visualising the solution

Solution orbits

Solution curves

Orbit graph

Phase plane



### Nullclines

> x-nullcline: $f(x,y)=0, \Large\frac{dx}{dt}$$=0$
> 
> y-nullcline: $g(x,y)=0, \Large\frac{dy}{dt}$$=0$




### Equilbrium points
Can be found by setting $f(x,y)=g(x,y)=0$



### Analysis

There are three possibilities for the orbit for a solution from a point in a region formed by nullclines

> * tends to equilibrium on border of region, or
> * goes to infinity, or
> * enters another neighbouring region following the gradient
