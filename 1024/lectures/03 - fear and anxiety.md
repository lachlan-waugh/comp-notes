## Stimuli and Cognitions

### Definitions and concepts

* It's really important to have clear definitions of your concepts (are these apples the same?).
* some researchers define fear and anxiety as the same thing (both appraise situation as threatening), others don't.
* Some argue that the two emotions have different **components**: the stimulus, thoughts, behaviours and physiological responses



### Differences of fear and anxiety

* *Stimulus*: the **thing** prompting an emotion.
  * *Fear*: stimulus is **specific**, and poses an **immediate threat** (e.g. something that could be avoided, or escaped).
  * *Anxiety*: **anticipation** of a **possible future threat**, the stimulus is usually vague or non-specific. This makes them difficult to avoid.

* These accounts rely on an **individuals perception** of how **severe and imminent** the threat is. Our cognitions play a role in fear and anxiety.
* Thoughts heavily influence whether we feel fear or anxiety, depending on which aspect of the threat we focus on
  * Fear: focus on the severity of the threat, and the outcome
  * Anxiety: focus on the likelihood or uncertainty of the threat occuring.



### Classical/Pavlovian conditioning

Stimulus and response

* Unconditioned: stimuli which elicit innate responses in us
* Conditioned: stimuli which have been trained to elicit a response
* Neutral: stimulus which has no response\



### Training a reponse

* Can train a neutral response into a conditioned response by eliciting a neutral and unconditioned stimulus at the same time.
* **Doesn't requires complex cognitive processes** (e.g. appraisal)
* Certain stimuli are much harder to associate with fear responses (especially modern ones like cars or guns)
  * **Preparedness theory**: these things are easier to condition, as they posed a threat to our ancestors. Ancestor's who survived would be the ones to pass on their genes.



### Verbal instruction and modelling

* You may have fears of something you've not experienced, or not fear something you've experienced 
  * **Verbal instruction:** humans have language, so we can communicate complex information (another way of learning fears)
  * **Modelling**: We can learn to fear stimuli if we see other people experience them, or fear them.



#### Experiments

* Cook and Mineka demonstrated modelling in monkeys fearing snakes, but didn't experience fear towards a flower
* Developed fear of triangle due to shocks -> told that they wouldn't receive shocks -> fear of triangle reduced
* Mary Cover Jones (1924): boy scared of white things -> put in room with other kids and shown they weren't scary -> fear reduced



### Associative learning

* An umbrella term for classical and instrumental conditioning
* Pavlov
  * Unconditioned stimulus: food
  * Conditioned stimulus: bell
  * Conditioned response: salivation
* **Extinction learning**: conditioned response wasn't permanent, if stimulus repeatedly presented with no food, dogs stopped drooling (prediction error)
* Watson
  * Fearing previous unfeared object
  * Little Albert learned to fear his toy white rat as it was paired with a sudden, large sound
  * Took 5 pairings before toy became fear
  * **Stimulus generalization**: Also spread to anything white and fluffy
* Mary Cover Jones
  * Peters fear of white rabbit reduced due to exposure to other children who weren't fearful of them
  * Fear did not return long after
* Skinner
  * Operant/Instrumental conditioning
  * **Law of Effect **(Edward Thorndike): consequence of behaviour influences whether it's performed more or less frequently in future.
  * Reinforcer -> behaviour increases
    * Positive: good thing happening
    * Negative: bad thing being removed
  * Punishes -> behaviour decreases
    * Positive: bad thing being added
    * Negative: good thing being removed



## Physiology and feelings

### SAM and the HPA Axis

* SAM: rapid response to a threat
* HPA axis: slower response, to a more enduring threat
* ANS helps deal with threats (heart rate, blood pressure, digestion)



### Autonomic nervous system

* Two main parts
  * Sympathethic NS: fight or flight system, manages survival functions (e.g. raises heart rate, blood pressure)
  * Parasympethetic NS: rest and digest system, calms us down, helps manage long-term survival (digestion),
* PSNS counters some SNS stuff (lowers heart rate, blood pressure)
* The two systems work concurrently, which part gets activated depends on the threat (proximity, type of threat)



### SAM (Sympathetic Adreno-medullar System)

* Sensory areas of brain detect threat, send messages along SNS
* Releases andrenaline and noradrenaline (**adrenaline rush**)
* Inhibits non-essential functions (e.g. digestion) by redirecting blood-flow



### HPA (Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal) Axis

* Doesn't rely on rapidly firing nerves, instead releases hormones into blood stream and waits for them to circulate, they find next organ which releases it's own hormones, etc
* Like a messages in a bottle, floating down a river
* Releases stress hormones (e.g. cortiosol) breaking down fat into sugar, used for a longer lasting energy supply for muscles



### Dimensional model of defensive behaviours (Hamm)

* Anxiety and fear exist on a continuum (which includes panic)
* Which you experience depends on imminence/proximity of the threat, as well as the environment context (e.g. opportunity to escape)
* Anxiety and fear occur in a cascade
  1. Pre-encounter defense: environment where a threat might occur (e.g. one experienced in the past)
     * experience general arousal, ANS activity, hypervigilence, increased processing in sensory areas of brain
  2. Post-encounter defense: detected threat, still in the distance
     * marked increase in fear potentiated startle, reduction in pain perception, physiological responses, autonomic aurosal
     * Fear bradycardia: heart rate decrease from distal threat
  3. Circa-strike defense: when the distal threat becomes immediate
     * Acute stress response, flooded with adrenaline/noradrenaline (SNS kicks in), fear-potentiated startle decreases
     * Tonic immobility: a freeze response (fight/flight)
     * Attentional resources get focused on the threat, everything else gets blocked out
     * Cognitive activity shifts from analytical/rational prefrontal areas to the emotional midbrain areas (including how memories are formed)



## Behaviours

### Facial expressions

* Characteristics of a fearful facial expression
  1. Eyebrows raised and pulled together

  2. Raised upper eyelids

  3. Tensed lower eyelids

  4. Jaw dropped open and lips stretched horizontally backwards

* Characteristics of anxious facial expression
  1. Alert, searching for danger
* Fear and anxiety have different facial expressions (Perkins/Collins)
  * Recorded giving reactions to different situations
  * Asked other participants to determine what emotions they were



### Overt behaviours

* Some argue fear and anxiety differ by motivational dimension
* McNaughton/Corr argue fear = avoidance, anxiety = approach
* Others argue avoidance motivation behaviours related to both
* Kryptos and colleagues: avoidance occurs when threat hasn't arrived, but you know it's coming (e.g. some cue)



### Avoidance

* **Passive**: omitting behaviour leading to bad outcome
* **Active**: enacting different behaviour that prevents bad outcome
* Some animal experts consider fight response an escape behaviour (fighting can have the same outcomes as putting distance between)
* **Instrumental conditioning**: avoidance and escape behaviour help us learn about the consequence of our behaviour in scary situations



### Fear-based negative reinforcement

* **Negative reinforcement**: learning that the behaviour makes the bad thing go away, making them feel better **in the short term**
* Three step process
  1. Encounters threatening situation (potentially or actual)
  2. Perform avoidance or escape behaviour
  3. Recognises threat no longer present (behaviour worked)



## Transcripts

### Stimuli and cognitions                      

Agh! Sorry, you scared me. Hey, what was that emotion that I just felt? Was it fear or was it
anxiety? Wait... aren’t they the same thing? Well, maybe but maybe not.
As you’ve probably gathered by now, scientists don’t always agree on things that the
general public might consider intuitive and self-explanatory. And as frustrating as this can be
for the average person, it’s simply because, when we get to the heart of these concepts,
they’re actually not as simple as we first thought.
Today, we’ll be unpacking the concepts of fear and anxiety. We’ll take a closer look at what
scientists have discovered about these two emotions and then see if we can come up with
an answer. Are fear and anxiety the same or are they different?

Now, before we jump in and start examining fear and anxiety as emotions, we first need to define our concepts. Defining emotions that we’ve all felt, like fear and anxiety, might seem a little trivial but, for science, definitions are really important. It’s vital to know that we’re all talking about the same thing and that we all have the same understanding of each concept.

To illustrate, if I showed you this picture and this picture, would you say they’re these things are the same? Some people will say, “Yeah, they’re both apples,” but others will say, “No, they’re different colours; they’re different.” These two people don’t have a clear definition of what the concept is. 

This is why it’s really important for scientists to clearly define their concepts. The scientific community may not agree on how the concept is defined but, clear definitions at least allow everyone can be on the same page. Everyone can understand “Ah, we’re talking about apples” versus “Ah, we’re talking about colours.”

So, how do scientists define fear and anxiety?
Well, surprise surprise, trying to get researchers to agree on definitions for these terms is a contentious topic. Some researchers argue that fear and anxiety are similar emotions because they both have similar components, like appraising the situation as threatening. 

Some researchers even go so far as to use the two terms interchangeably.
Other researchers say, yeah, they both involve appraising a threat but the stimulus – the actual thing that people find threatening – that’s different depending on whether the person is fearful or anxious. And it’s not just this one component that differs; our thoughts, behaviours and physiological responses can be different too depending on whether we’re feeling fear or anxiety. And this is why lots of emotion researchers argue that fear and anxiety are distinct constructs. The emotions of fear and anxiety often have different components, so in this course, we're going to treat them as different too. 

I mentioned before that the thing that people find threatening is different when someone is fearful versus when they’re anxious. We refer to that thing as a stimulus. With both fear and anxiety, the stimulus is perceived as a threat but, as you’ll see in a minute, the nature of this threat seems to differ between the two emotions. 

When someone is fearful, the stimulus is typically something specific and it poses an immediate threat. People usually describe fear evoking stimuli as something that can theoretically be avoided or something that they can escape from.

So, one example might be, you’re having a bonfire and toasting marshmallows, but you have a fear of getting burnt. You can see that this is a really specific threat that is right in front of us. And we could avoid that threat, either by not getting too close to the fire or not having one in the first place. Or once the fire is there, we could also escape the threat by moving away from it or putting the fire out.

In contrast, the stimulus for anxiety is described as anticipation of a possible future threat. The scary thing isn’t happening right now, but it could happen in the future. And unlike fear, where the person can pinpoint the thing that they’re fearful of, the threat associated with anxiety is usually vague or nonspecific.

Actually, themes of ambiguity and uncertainty come up a lot with anxiety. And lots of accounts argue that because the anxious stimuli are vague, they can’t easily be avoided in the same clear-cut way as fearful stimuli. So, someone might feel anxious about “doing poorly” at uni, without any clear or specific reason to anticipate that. You can see in this example that the threat is vague and non-specific. It’s not very well defined, we don’t know what “doing poorly” looks like. Is it failing a test? Failing a course? Dropping out of your degree? And because of this vague definition, it's not something that can easily be avoided in a clear-cut way. I mean sure, you can study and do your work, but there’s still that uncertainty about exactly how things are going to pan out.

So, we get this picture that for fear, the threat is specific and immediate, something right here, right now. Consequently, we can actively do something to avoid or escape that threatening stimulus. In contrast, for anxiety, the threat is a vague and non-specific future threat that is anticipated. Anxiety happens in response to an ambiguous or uncertain situation. Because of this, anxiety provoking stimuli are not things that we can easily avoid or escape.

You might have noticed that many of these accounts rely on an individual’s perception of how severe and imminent the threat is. What this means is that our cognitions can play a role in stimulating fear and anxiety. Some researchers have even demonstrated that just imagining fearful stimuli in your mind can increase your startle response. So even that mental process of visualising threat can elicit a fear response.

Our thoughts can also influence whether we feel fear or whether we feel anxiety. And this depends on what aspect of threat we focus on. So, if we focus more on the severity of a threat and how bad the outcome would be we’re more likely to feel fear. But if we focus more on the possibility or likelihood of a threat occurring then we're more likely to feel anxiety. You can see those same themes popping up again with anxiety; it seems to happen
when we’re focusing on the uncertainty and our susceptibility to the threat.
Up until now, we’ve been focusing on the characteristics of stimuli that provoke fear versus the characteristics of stimuli that provoke anxiety. But how do we know which stimuli are threatening. We experience millions of different sights, sounds, smells, tastes and environmental contexts each day. How does our brain know which of those stimuli are dangerous? Well, there are a few different ways that we learn which stimuli pose a potential threat.

Today, we’re going to talk about classical conditioning, verbal instruction and modelling.

Classical conditioning
Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov was the first to identify classical conditioning in dogs. Essentially, he discovered that he could train dogs to drool when they heard the sound of footsteps. And he did this simply by walking loudly towards the dog’s cages each day and then giving them their daily food. Ok, dogs drooling when they hear footsteps is pretty funny but what does that have to do with fear and anxiety? Well, it turns out that the same learning processes that underpinned the dogs’ sound-food association also underpin how we can learn about which stimuli are threatening. We’ll cover classical conditioning in more detail in this week’s online workshop but I also wanted to give you a brief overview now.

The basic premise of classical conditioning is that there are some stimuli that elicit innate responses in us. So, for example, electric shocks cause a pain response. The electric shock is called unconditioned stimulus and the pain is called the unconditioned response. These are unconditioned because we don’t need to learn to feel pain when we get an electric shock.
Our nervous system just automatically produces a pain response whenever we feel an electric shock right from the moment we’re born.

These things are not learnt, so they’re unconditioned.
Well, it turns out that if an unconditioned stimulus, like an electric shock, is repeatedly presented at the same time or just after you experience a neutral stimulus, like a car door handle or a shopping trolley, then we learn that the object and the electric shock are related. We form an association between these two stimuli.
This can be a bit of a bizarre thing to wrap your head around so let me give you an example. For most of us, a car door handle is probably a neutral stimulus. We don’t feel any particular desire or aversion towards it; it’s just an object that exists in the environment. But it might be a really windy day and lots of static electricity builds up, and then every time you touch the car door handle you get a zap that hurts. It might only take a couple of these static electric shocks before you’re hesitant to touch the door handle from fear of getting zapped again! Your previously neutral car door handle has been associated with the electric shock and has started to elicit a fear response in you! The door handle is now a conditioned stimulus that elicits a conditioned fear response.

This is classical fear conditioning. A previously neutral stimulus gets trained or conditioned to elicit a fear response because it’s been associated with something painful or threatening. The once neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus that elicits the conditioned response - fear! One really important thing to mention about this concept is that it makes no mention of
those cognitive components of emotion that we studied earlier, like in appraisal theory for example. Animals do not need complex cognitive abilities or language to learn through classical conditioning. Sea slugs can learn this stuff!

In terms of fear and anxiety research, classical conditioning is important to understand because it demonstrates how bad experiences can teach us to associate certain stimuli with threat. But as a theory Classical Conditioning doesn’t perfectly explain all fear stimuli all on its own. For one, not all stimuli are created equal. Have you ever met anyone who’s afraid of snakes? What about flowers?

A conditioned fear response seems to be much more easily learned with certain categories of natural stimuli such as animals, storms, heights or open or closed spaces. On the other hand, it’s much harder to learn to fear other stimuli like food, flowers, sunrises and even some modern stimuli like cars and guns. Humans are much more likely to fear storms than modern stimuli like cars even if those modern stimuli present a statistically greater risk than
something like a storm.

One of the theories that has been proposed to explain why we seem predisposed to develop fears towards natural stimuli like animals and storms is Preparedness Theory. Preparedness Theory argues that the reason we quickly develop fears towards these natural stimuli is because these things posed a genuine risk to our ancestors. From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense for the nervous system to rapidly learn that certain animals, for
example, are potentially painful rather than learning that daisies for example, are potentially painful. Because certain natural stimuli like snakes, storms and heights can pose a genuine threat to us [animation], animals that take a long time to learn to fear those stimuli may not live long enough to pass on their genes.

On the other hand, animals that learnt to fear and avoid potentially threatening stimuli after just one or two painful encounters, those animals would have a much better chance at surviving and passing on those genes that helped them learn about potentially dangerous stimuli so quickly.
But even after taking into account preparedness theory, classical conditioning still doesn’t perfectly explain how we acquire all our fears. Like, there are lots of times when we may have actually had a bad experience with a stimulus, but then we DON’T fear it. Like, I’ve been bitten by dogs, snakes, spiders, fish, cats, birds - I think that’s it - but I don’t fear any of
them! I love most animals. Also, we don’t always need to have had firsthand experience with a stimulus and the unconditioned response in order to fear it. Like, I’ve never experienced the pain of being bitten by a crocodile, but I know that crocodiles are pretty dangerous, and I don’t think I’d like to be close to one!

And so, it turns out there are at least two ways that we can acquire fear.
So, humans have another amazing tool that helps us learn. It’s something that no other species on the planet has. We have language! Language allows us to communicate and convey complex information about things we haven’t even experienced firsthand. This is called Verbal Instruction. For example, most of us probably haven’t ever experienced zapping ourselves on an electric fence, and we probably haven’t seen anyone else do it either, but we all know that it is dangerous and painful. Most of us have learnt this either by reading a sign or from being told by other people that this object is dangerous and we shouldn’t touch it. We’ve learnt about the threatening stimulus through verbal or written instruction.

We can also learn that certain stimuli are dangerous if we see other people affected by these stimuli or see other people fear them. For example, we might see our parent burn themselves on the stove and learn that it's dangerous, or we might see our parent demonstrate fear of dogs and learn that they are dangerous, even without experiencing any bad events ourselves. This concept is called modelling and it’s pretty common in social
species like ourselves and other primates.

Cook and Mineka have demonstrated this phenomenon in monkeys too. They showed one naïve monkey with no experience of snakes a video of two other monkeys demonstrating fear of a snake, and the original naïve monkey then demonstrated fear of snakes even though they’d never encountered one before.

What’s really interesting is that all these different concepts – classical conditioning, preparedness theory, verbal instructions and modelling – they can actually work together to shape our fears.

So, even though the monkey developed a fear of snakes through modelling, when this same monkey saw a video of another monkey showing fear towards a flower, the monkey didn’t then develop a fear of flowers. Evolutionary preparedness has made us primates predisposed to quickly and efficiently learn about potentially dangerous things like snakes but not towards flowers because they aren’t usually deadly. 

The same sort of interaction can happen with verbal instructions and conditioning. For example, in one study, human participants saw a triangle on a computer screen and then received a mild electric shock. Over time, the participants began to fear the triangle. But then, the experimenter said to them, “Ok we’re not going to give you any more electric shocks. We’ll show you the triangle, but we won’t do any more shocks.” And the participants were like, sweet; their fear towards the triangle reduced simply because verbal instruction from the experimenter told them that this stimulus wasn’t scary anymore.

And this can happen with classical conditioning and modelling too. We’ll go into this in more detail in the workshop but, in 1924, a pioneering woman, Mary Cover Jones, discovered a boy called Peter. Peter was terrified of white rabbits, white rats, white fluffy rugs, white fur coats – you get the idea. To help Peter overcome his fear, Mary Cover Jones put Peter in a room with some other non-fearful children, some toys and the white rabbit. Over time as Peter saw that, not only was the rabbit not hurting him, but the rabbit wasn’t hurting other kids either. And so, his fear towards the white rabbit eventually reduced to the point where he was able to happily play with the rabbit, just like the other kids.

Thanks for watching! In this lecture we covered difference between fear and anxiety and three different ways we learn to fear stimuli, classical conditioning, verbal instruction and modelling. We also talked about how preparedness theory predisposes us and other animals to develop fear towards certain types of stimuli but not others. Next time we’ll look at what happens in our bodies and minds when we’re afraid in Physiology and Subjective Feelings.

​                     

### Physiology and feelings

Physiology and feelings. They’re the proverbial glue that joins the stimuli of fear and anxiety to the behaviours of fear and anxiety. The physiological changes in our body shape our conscious experience of feelings. And what we feel influences what we do. Our physiology and our feelings play a big role in driving the other aspects of our emotions, including our behaviour.

The changes that happen in your body during fear are actually part of the stress response. We’ll cover that more in week 10, but today we’ll focus on the physiology of fear and anxiety.

When we’re presented with a threat stimulus, our body experiences a whole bunch of physiological changes. Today, I want to introduce you to two systems that produce those physiological changes, SAM and the HPA axis.
At a really broad level, SAM helps our bodies rapidly respond to the threat. 

On the other hand, the HPA axis takes its time. It helps us bunker down and respond to a more enduring threat. When we encounter a threat, our Autonomic Nervous System kicks into gear to help us quickly deal with that threat. Just as its name suggests, the autonomic nervous system controls all the automatic functions in our body. Things like our heart rate, blood pressure and digestion. 

The autonomic nervous system has two main branches:
The Sympathetic Nervous System is widely considered the “fight or flight” system of our bodies. When we’re faced with a threat, the sympathetic nervous system manages lots of survival functions like our increasing heart rate and blood pressure.

The Parasympathetic Nervous System is widely considered to be the “rest and digest” system. It chills everything out and manages our more long-term survival functions, things like digestion. The parasympathetic nervous system also opposes sympathetic nervous system in some areas. So, where the sympathetic nervous system will increase heart rate and blood pressure, the parasympathetic nervous system will slow the heart rate back down
again and lower our blood pressure. 

For a long time, the sympathetic nervous system was often considered the accelerator and parasympathetic nervous system was the brakes. But more recent evidence suggests that these two branches can also work concurrently. It’s not an either/or, all or nothing type situation. One example of this is defensive freezing which we’ll discuss in a minute.

Part of this whole threat response is the Sympathetic Adreno-medullar System, also known as SAM. Essentially, the sensory areas of our brain detect the threat in the environment and send messages along our sympathetic nervous system to quickly respond to that threat. As well as increasing our vigilance and alertness SAM is also responsible for releasing
adrenaline and noradrenaline. This is that “adrenaline rush” that you may have felt when you’re scared.

SAM controls all those physiological effects that go on in the body like inhibiting non-essential functions like digestion. This is achieved by redirecting blood flow away from our digestive system and into our muscles. Basically, if we’re about to get eaten by a bear, we don’t really care about digesting that hamburger we had for lunch. We want our muscles to work so we can either fight the bear or run away from it. SAM is also behind those changes in heart rate, sweating, increasing our breathing rate and blood pressure. We often experience these physiological changes as feelings in the body. I spoke about that adrenaline rush before but things like changes in blood flow and sweating can make us feel clammy and changes in digestion might be responsible for feeling butterflies in stomach.

Now, if SAM were a sprinter then the HPA axis is a marathon runner. The Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis or HPA axis works much slower than SAM. This is because it doesn’t rely on rapid firing nerves. Instead, the HPA axis works by releasing a series of hormones into the blood stream and then waiting for those hormones to circulate and then find the next organ in the chain. And yeah, obviously it’s gonna take time for your blood to pump all
those hormones around your body and then the next round of hormones and so on.

And so you might like to think of SAM as delivering its neural messages along optic fibres and the HPA axis delivering its hormone message in a bottle flowing down a river. One of the main functions of the HPA axis is to release stress hormones like cortisol which breaks down fat into sugar, so you have longer lasting energy to supply your muscles. We spoke in the last lecture about the similarities and differences between fear and anxiety.

One model that can help us understand the physiological components of these two emotions, is the Dimensional Model of Defensive Behaviours proposed by Hamm. We’re going to look at the latest version of this model, but there are a number of similar iterations of this model that it was based on.

So, remember in Week 2 I spoke about dimensional accounts of emotion? Well, according to this view, anxiety and fear exist on a continuum. Hamm argues that the factor that determines whether we feel anxiety, fear or full-blown panic is the imminence or proximity of the threat. This in turn determines the physiological changes that happen in our bodies.

Recall our last lecture where we talked about how anxiety tends to have more distant and vague threats, whereas fear tends to have more imminent and specific threats. Well according to these dimensional models, anxiety and fear occur in a cascade. 

According to these models, we first have this Pre-encounter Phase of Defense.

We’ve just entered an environment where there MIGHT be a threat. So, this could be a situation where there may have previously been a threat, but we just haven’t identified one yet. Alternatively, the situation might just be uncertain, ambiguous, or novel. A bit like those first day at a new school jitters! So, in this phase our bodies work to pre-empt a threat that we may experience. We get this increase in general arousal; the autonomic nervous system turns things up a notch.

As a result, we exhibit hypervigilance, we’re on the lookout for the threat. And interestingly, its actually been demonstrated that during this phase we have increased processing in the sensory areas of the brain - this makes sense if you’re exhibiting hypervigilance. You’re quite literally are on the lookout for danger. Just like we spoke about in the last lecture, the threat in this anxiety provoking situation is distal and ambiguous. You can’t actually see anything wrong but you’re vigilantly scanning around just in case!

The next stage is the Post-encounter Defense. This is where we’ve detected an actual threat but it’s still off in the distance.

So, imagine you’re terrified of green lollipops. You’re sitting in the lecture theatre when out of the corner of your eye, you see it - someone’s discarded, half eaten green lollipop sitting in the far corner of the room. You immediately tune out everything else, you’re frozen stock still, you could swear your heart just stopped, you start to sweat and you become fixated on
the green lollipop. Just at that moment, your friend comes in late to the lecture but you’re so focused on the threatening stimulus that you don’t even notice them tip toeing in behind you. Your friend taps you on the shoulder and, in front of the whole class, you go “blahhh!” You bash your knee on the fold-down table and knock your laptop on the floor. Crash! This complete overreaction to your friend tapping you on the shoulder is one of the
hallmarks of post-encounter defense - a marked increase in fear potentiated startle. This is why you jumped out of your skin when your friend subtly tapped you on the shoulder. One of the other effects of post-encounter defense is a reduction in pain perception. So, even though you smashed your knee on the table at least you didn’t feel it until much later. The physiological responses like sweating suggests that you’re experiencing an increase in autonomic arousal. You’d think that your sympathetic nervous system is kicking in and activating that fight or flight response. And that’s true but it’s not the only thing going on. Do you remember I said earlier that the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems aren’t an all or nothing, either/or situation?

One of the interesting things that can happen when
we’re confronted with a distal threat is that our heart rate decreases. This is called fear bradycardia. During post-encounter defensive and freezing, both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system become activated. This means that a person can show a mix of physiological reactions such fear bradycardia, which is related to the
parasympathetic nervous system, but also simultaneously show an increase in sweating, which is related to the sympathetic nervous system. And so, the old account that the sympathetic nervous system activates the fight/flight response and then the parasympathetic nervous system calms it down afterwards is not the whole story. Both branches work in concert.
The aspects of each system that get activated or suppressed at any particular time seems to be related to things like how close the threat is, the type of threat and whether the threat has been encountered before or not.

The final stage in the model is the Circa-strike Defense. This is where that distal threat now becomes an imminent threat. Oh no, your friend has seen the green lollipop and they want to put it in the bin behind you! Your friend picks up the lollipop and is now bringing it towards you! You’ve gone from
scared to terrified!

Circa-strike Defense is where you show an acute stress response.
Just like with all our other emotions, our physiological and behavioural response to the stimulus is going to be dependent on the characteristics of the stimulus. So, if your friend is carrying that lollipop towards you but can escape out of the nearest exit, then your body will prepare for “flight”. But if someone can’t escape the threat, then their body may get ready to fight the threat or they may experience a freeze response known as tonic immobility. This is where a person is so terrified of an inescapable threat that they become immobile and unresponsive.

But in your situation, you’re able to escape out the nearest exit, so your body prepares for flight. Your sympathetic nervous system kicks into overdrive. You’re flooded with adrenaline and noradrenaline. You start to sweat profusely, and your heart starts racing. Contrary to the post-encounter defense stage, in circa-strike defense your fear potentiated startle decreases. Instead, your muscles prepare for actual action. One of the interesting things that happens when faced with such an imminent threat is that all of the attentional resources get focused on the threat and everything else gets blocked out. You’re so focused on that lollipop and getting away from it that you don’t even realise you’ve left your laptop on the ground and the lecturer is calling you to see if you’re ok.

The brain’s activity and the way that it processes information changes during circa-strike defense as well. Activity shifts from the more analytic and rational prefrontal areas to the more emotional midbrain areas. And all of this changes cognitive processes right down to the way that memories are formed and the content of those memories.

And you can see that, even in a threatening situation, these same components of emotion surface again and again. There is an event, situation or stimulus. And the characteristics of that stimulus, say how close or far away it is, and the environmental context, like, “Can I get away from this threat?” those features all determine what we think, our physiological
responses and how we behave in response to that threat. 

Thanks for watching! In this lecture we looked at the physiology of fear and anxiety. We covered the SAM system and the HPA axis and looked at how our bodies and minds respond to different threatening situations using the Dimensional Model of Defensive Behaviours. In the next lecture we’re going to focus in on those behaviours when we take a look at facial expressions, motivational behaviours and how two different types of learning can work in
tandem to create and maintain our fears



### Behaviours

What emotion would you say these people are feeling? If you think back to Paul Ekman’s work on facial expressions, you’ll recall that most people on the planet would correctly identify that these people are afraid. Remember Ekman’s work found that humans are pretty reliable with our facial expressions for a range of emotions including fear, sadness, anger, disgust, happiness.

But how do we know that this person is feeling the emotion fear? What features in the facial expression communicate that information? Ekman’s researched has shown that the characteristics of a fearful facial expression are:

1. Eyebrows raised and pulled together
2. Raised upper eyelids
3. Tensed lower eyelids
4. Jaw dropped open and lips stretched horizontally backwards

What’s really interesting is that it turns out that there’s also evidence to suggest that anxiety elicits a different facial expression to fear. And, given our discussions about how anxiety and fear have different physiology and functions, the fact that they also have different behaviours shouldn’t be surprising. Many researchers consider them to be different emotions so it makes sense that they would have different behavioural components.

So, how did scientists discover that the facial expressions for fear and anxiety were different? Well, Perkins and colleagues gave a participants a bunch of hypothetical scenarios and asked them to pose and pull the facial expression that was relevant for the emotion they’d feel in that scenario.

It turns out that if the situation has those traits we spoke about for anxiety, things like ambiguous threat, the participants showed a very different facial expression to the standard fear response that they showed to unambiguous threat.

So, this is the face people showed in response to the ambiguous threat scenarios, and you can see that they are showing behaviors consistent with vigilance and scanning the environment for threat – in the videos the participants were darting their eyes and swiveling their head, looking for that threat. This is looking a lot like anxiety.

But, just to be sure their interpretation of these faces is correct, the researchers showed these facial expressions to 40 new participants and asked those new participants to label the emotions. Sure enough, the participants reliably labelled face number 1 as anxiety and face number 6 as fear.

So, that’s facial expressions but what about more overt behaviours? Well, some researchers conceptualise fear and anxiety differ in terms of where they fall on the motivational dimension [animation]. McNaughton and Corr have argued that fear is more of an avoidance emotion. Just like we mentioned in the last lecture, fear tends to be associated with escape behaviours where you move away from threat that is already there. In contrast, the authors argue that anxiety is more of an approach emotion. 

Remember that anxiety elicits hypervigilance to help you look out for possible approaching threat. This account seems consistent with the expressions we talked about a moment ago, fear expressions showed people moving back away from the stimulus but anxiety showed people bunkering down and scanning.

But, it’s not always that simple. Of course it can’t be simple! Humans are complex beings and there’s lots of factors that come into play. Some other researchers have pointed out that behaviours of high avoidance-motivation can be related to both fear and anxiety, and so this simplistic spectrum isn’t enough. 

The behaviours of fear and anxiety really should be classified in more detail.
So, according to Kryptos and colleagues, avoidance behaviours occur when you know that a threat is coming because there’s some cue for it. The threat hasn’t actually arrived yet, but you know it’s coming. So, this might be me getting into the car on a windy day and I just know that if I touch the door handle, I'm going to get a static electric shock. What are my options?

Well, according to Kryptos I could do passive avoidance, which is just omitting the behaviour that will lead to the bad outcome. So, I could just stand there forever and hope the wind dies down on its own or I could hope my friend opens the door for me. OR, I could do active avoidance, which is enacting a different behaviour that will prevent the bad outcome. So, I could put rubber gloves on before I touch the door. Genius!

But what about those times when the threat is already present? Let's think back to our green lollipop in the lecture theatre example. If I am afraid of green lollipops and I notice a green lollipop down the front of the lecture hall, that threat is already present. It’s not like I can do something to prevent it happening. It’s already there. Instead, what I am likely to do is an escape behaviour, which is some sort of escape behaviour where I can put some
distance in between me and the threat. So, I might get up and run out of the lecture hall.

What’s really interesting is that many animal behaviour experts will also consider the fight response an escape behaviour too and this is simply because fighting the threat, or at least threatening to fight the threat, has the same outcome of putting distance in between themselves and the trigger. Aggressing makes that scary thing go away. And a person might react similarly if that terrifying green lollipop was being brought towards them about they were trapped in the corner of the lecture theatre. The person might scream “GET IT AWAY FROM ME!” so that the person takes it away.

So, what’s the purpose of avoidance and escape behaviours? Well, evolutionarily speaking, they serve a really important purpose. They help us to survive. If we’re putting distance between ourselves and a threat, or avoiding that threat entirely, then the scary, dangerous thing can’t hurt us. And so, you can see how these behaviours would be adaptive.

Avoidance and escape behaviours help us to learn about the consequences of our behaviour in scary situations. This is a special type of learning called instrumental conditioning. Now, there are a few different types of instrumental conditioning and we’ll cover them in detail in this week’s workshop but the type of instrumental conditioning we're going to talk about now is negative reinforcement.

Fear-based negative reinforcement happens in a kind of three step process. 

In Step 1, the person encounters a threatening situation. Now, this can be either a potentially threatening situation or it can be a situation where the threat is actually present.

In Step 2, the person performs the avoidance or escape behaviour. This could be anything from actually running away from the scary thing, it could be avoiding that situation altogether or the person may perform some other safety behaviour or ritual to make themselves feel safer. A bit like a behavioural safety blanket.eg

In Step 3, the person recognises that the threat is no longer present and so they’re no longer scared. The escape, avoidance or safety behaviour has
made the threat go away, so the person feels better again.

Let me say that again because it’s really important. Negative reinforcement is when the person learns that performing the behaviour makes the scary thing go away, and this makes them feel better in the short term. This favourable outcome reinforces that association between the action - the escape/avoidance behaviours - and feeling better. The association
between the action and the outcome gets strengthened [animation]. In turn, this means that the escape/avoidance behaviour is more likely to be performed in the future if the person is faced with a similar circumstance.

Now, in situations that are legitimately dangerous this is an adaptive response. However, these behaviours can become maladaptive if they are excessive, if they cause distress or interfere with a person’s life and their goals. If a person is perpetually running away from or avoiding situations where they may see green lollipops, then this can start impacting their
quality of life. 

We’ll go into more detail about how this applies to anxiety disorders in the coming weeks. Thanks for watching! In this lecture we spoke about the behaviours of fear and anxiety. We talked about how each of these emotions has different facial expressions and different behaviours that help serve the purpose of each emotion. We also spoke about the role of escape and avoidance and a special type of learning called negative reinforcement.
