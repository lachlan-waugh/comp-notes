## mood and depression

* anxiety and mood disorders leading type of mental disorder $12.6 billion annually
  * over 6% have experienced in the last year
  * depression most common (5% women, 3% men)
* Bipolar used to be an affective disorder, now its Persistent Depressive



### Who experiences mood disorders

* Study found women 2x more common to be diagnosed
* Women carry higher risk throughout teens - yong adult (risk tapers post-menopause). Men have low in teen, peaks 35-44, falls later in life
* Marriage has a protective effect
  * Some say protective for men, increase risk for women
* Mood disorders in widowed, separated or divorced (or non-married)
* Highest risk: woman, 20-30, unemployed, 3 children under 10



### Australia depression

* just under 15% of unemployed, 10% not in the labour force (which doesn't include retirees or stay at home). employed lowest rates of 5%
* highest: those with no school, lowest: those with just school
* people with tertiary have slightly higher rate of diagnosis of mood disorders compared to people with only secondary



### Effects

* depression and mood disorders have greater impairment than anxiety
* 2/3 of people with depression report high/very high psychological distress. 6 days a month unable to complete their role



### Depressive episodes

* heterogenous: two people with disorder can have different symptoms
* symptoms
  * low mood
  * loss of interest in activities they enjoy
  * loss of pleasure and fullfillment
  * changes in appetite/weight, sleep/energy (either up or down)
  * difficulty concentrating/low motivation



### Major depressive disorder

* different to depressive episodes
* characterised as recurrent episodes of major depression



## the cognitive model of depression



### schemas

* schemas: abstract cognitive construct that assign meaning to stimuli
  * dsyfunctional attitudes
  * activated when person experiences a negative event in their life.
  * starts a chain of negative thought patterns, resulting in depression
* Beck's cognitive triad: negative schemas lead people to black and white negative beliefs about themselves, the world, and future



### Bias

* **Systematic cognitive bias**:  activated schemas change how we perceive the world
* **Attention bias**: depressed people respond to negative stimuli faster
* Depressed people seeing neutral faces thought they were sad
* **Memory bias**: sad people recall sad memories



### Cognitive control

* **automatic appraisals**: schemas allow us to make shortcuts in judgements, saving cognitive resources
* **cognitive control system**: used when we have no automatic appraisal
  * supressed during a depressive episode



### Cognitive vulnerability

* Early significant traumatic events create enduiring attitudes, and feelings of helplessness/hopelessness if similar events happen again
* **Cognitive vulnerability**: People experiencing loss more likely to experience depression when experiencing another loss.
* In vulnerable individuals, less severe events can trigger episodes too. This vulnerability is progressive (less severe events cause episodes)



### Genetic disposition

* hyperactive amygdala
* underactive prefrontal cortex, causes sluggishness, and diminished cognitive appraisals
* overactive stress response can lead to dysfunctional schemas
* **hypercortisolemia**: when body is flooded with cotrisol over and over, disrupting other chemicals (such as serotonin)



### Serotonin

* Mixture of short and long transporters
* Some people have only long, some only short
* Long transporters carry more serotonin, which can provide protection against serious adverse events
* Children with 2x short: even when non-depressed, evaluate themselves negative when their mood is low



### Major depressive episodes

* activated schemas influence appraisal of stressful life events
* daily negative appraisal of life events leads to low mood, increasing risk of depression
* negative view skews information processing
* repeated activation of schemas leads to hypersensitivity



## the behavioural activation model

* Behaviour plays a role in the maintenance of depression
* Depression increases escape behaviour, driven by negative reinforcement. Escape behaviour driven by something aversive.
* Escape behaviour indicates aversive behaviour in life
* Life factors are both risk factors, and catalysts for depression
* 20-55% of adults demonstrate at least mild depressive symptoms in life
* Risk of depression fluctuates in life stages, and circumstances



### model

* argues environment plays part in development of depression
* depressed people decrease in behaviour of **positive reinforcement**
* depressed people get less **functional reinforcement** in their daily lives



### factors of depression

* avoidance
* withdrawal
* inactivity



### functional analysis

* functional enforcers/punishers cornerstones of behaviour perspectives
  * **enforcers**: make person feel good when they perform
  * **punishers**: make person feel bad when they perform
  * *can be positive and negative reinforcement/punishment*
* behaviours continue because something maintains them



### TRAP model

* Process
  * **Trigger**: environmental/contextual stimulus initiating episode
  * **Response**: cognitive/physiological components (low mood)
  * **Avoidance Pattern**: behavioural components
* Avoidance behaviour doesn't actually fix the core problem
* Many cases where people can't change circumstances (poverty)
* People begin to withdrawal from other situations, not just aversive situations. Lowering overall mood



* depression as a result of situation, rather than defect/characteristic
* Learned Helplessness: learning you can't change circumstances, so they give up trying



### Uses

* Both models are used in therapy
* Cognitive model provided basis for cognitive therapy
* Behavioural activation model informed behavioural activiation therapy

### mood and depression

Anxiety and mood disorders are the most common types of mental disorders in this country and across the globe. Together, they’re the leading cause of non-fatal disability in Australia, with an estimated cost of $12.6 billion annually.

The 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing reported that just over 6% of Australians had experienced a mood disorder in the past year. Depression was the most common mood disorder with just over 5% of females and just over 3% of males having experienced a depressive episode in that time. 

![img](file:///tmp/lu1972794xsdb.tmp/lu1972794xskn_tmp_14956b8f28ad22ab.png)



Now, keep in mind that 1) this data represents people diagnosed, so the undiagnosed numbers have been recorded here, 2) gender diversity and gender non-conformity has not been investigated in this particular study and 3) DSM has now changed the classification of bipolar. Where it used to be placed in the affective disorders category, it has now been split out into its own category. Dysthymia is also now referred to as **Persistent Depressive Disorder.**

Despite all this, we can still take away the knowledge that mood disorders, and depression in particular is very, very common.

Just as this survey suggests, different genders experience depression at different rates. One study found that twice as many women as men are diagnosed with depression and this trend has been replicated in a number of other studies in many different countries.

Males and females tend to experience depression at different stages in their lives. Females carry a higher risk throughout their teen, and younger adult years, with the risk tapering post-menopause. The risk for males is a bit different. It starts low in the teen years, peaks between the ages of 35-44 and then falls again later in life. Again, keep in mind that this graph represents diagnosed affective disorders so there may be an aspect of underdiagnosis in certain groups.

One really interesting thing that has emerged from a number of different studies is the effect that marriage has on rates of depression and how this effect differs for men and women. Overall, marriage seems to have a protective effect, with mood disorders being most prevalent in people who have been widowed, separated or divorced, but also in people who have never married or those in de facto relationships.

However, the relationship between marriage and depression is not a simple one. Some studies suggest that whilst marriage appears to have a protective effect for men, it can increase the risk of depression for women. A number of investigations have concluded that the privilege that accrues for married men, and the oppressions and burdens that can accrue for married women, play a big role in driving this trend.

Another really interesting study found that women aged 20-30 who were unemployed with 3 children under the age of 10 were at the greatest risk of depression. This is obviously a really challenging position for a person to be in and I’d like you to keep this in mind when we go through the models of depression in the next two lectures.

In Australia, mood disorders are most common in people who are unemployed. Just under 15% of people who are unemployed have depression compared to about 10% of people who are not in the labour force. This would include stay at home parents or retirees for example. People who are employed tend to have the lowest rates of depression at just over 5%.

In terms of education, depression is highest for people who did not complete school and lowest for those with only a school qualification. Interestingly, a slightly higher number of people with a tertiary education have been diagnosed with a mood disorder compared to people with only secondary schooling. 

So, what is the impact of depression? Well, depression and mood disorders more generally tend to have greater impairment than anxiety disorders, at least on the measures taken in this survey. Roughly two thirds of people with depression report high or very high levels of psychological distress and, on average, people with mood disorders were unable to undertake their role for 6 days out of the previous month due to their symptoms.

So, what are some of the symptoms of a major depressive episode?

Well, depression can be quite a heterogenous disorder. This means that two different people who both meet the clinical criteria for the disorder can have very different symptoms and lived experience.

Some of the typical symptoms seen in a **depressive episode** include low mood, loss of interest in activities that they used to enjoy, or sometimes if the person is does get out and do those activities, they may not feel the same pleasure and fulfillment as they once did. The person may experience changes in their appetite and/or weight, they may experience sleep disturbances, and may experience disruptions to their energy levels. Now, for these symptoms of appetite and weight, sleep and energy, the change can go in either direction, so it might go up or down. People with depression may also experience symptoms like difficulty concentrating or low motivation.

And so, you can see that depression isn’t just feeling sad. Depression encompasses a whole constellation of different things and it may look quite different from person to person. 

Just like with the anxiety disorders that we spoke about earlier in the course, we need to remember our general principles. Symptoms must cause clinically significant distress and/or impair the person’s functioning; the symptoms must be excessive for a person in their situation. And finally, the symptoms must be persistent; they’re not fleeting feelings.

Now, if you were super observant, you may have noticed that I introduced those symptoms as typical of a **depressive episode**. That’s because a depressive episode and **Major Depressive Disorder** are different. A depressive episode is a single instance of depression whereas Major depressive disorder is characterised by recurrent episodes of major depression.

In the following lectures, we’ll briefly go into one model that explains how a single episode can then progress to recurrent episodes but by and large we won’t really be splitting these terms as the distinction is beyond the scope of this course.

Thanks for watching! In this lecture we talked about the demographics of people who experience depression, the impact that depression and other affective disorders have on the person and also the symptoms of depression.

In the next lecture we’re going to talk about one of the most influential models of depression that accounts for the development and maintenance of the disorder and has also been instrumental in informing evidence-based treatment for the disorder. Tune in next time when we tackle the cognitive model of depression.



### the cognitive model

Ever had that experience where you don’t agree with someone simply because you’re coming at the problem from a different angle? You might even both be right about certain aspects.

This is a situation that happens in science all the time. In this lecture and in the next one, we’re going to take a look at two very different models of depression, both of which have a lot of empirical support behind them. You’ll see that these two theories focus on very different components of emotion, one highlights the role of cognition whereas the other highlights the role of behaviour and learning. Both of them mention stimuli and the environments that people find themselves in, but the role they see stimuli playing is quite different.

Let’s start with the cognitive model of depression.

The cognitive model of depression obviously focuses on cognitive components of emotions, but the stimuli also feature highly too.

The original authors of this model, Aaron Beck and David Clark have also begun to integrate physiological aspects into this model but they acknowledge that this integration is really in its early stages. At the moment, their proposed relationships between cognitions and physiology are hypotheses waiting to be tested!

At the heart of the cognitive model are dysfunctional attitudes that the authors refer to as **schemas.** In this model, schemas become activated when a person experiences a negative event in their life. The activated schema then starts a chain of negative thought patterns that results in the symptoms of depression.

Ok, so what is a schema? Well, according to the authors, **schemas are an abstract cognitive construct that assign meaning to stimuli**. They’re a bit like our conceptual understanding of different things. They also contain our beliefs and attitudes towards that thing. So, for instance, your self-schema contains all the knowledge and understanding that you have about yourself as well as the beliefs and attitudes that you hold about yourself.

But sometimes our schemas are dysfunctional. They either may not accurately represent the way things are. Like, part of my self-schema might be that I’m short, when in fact I’m actually bang on average height. This would be an inaccuracy in my self-schema. Dysfunctional schemas may also be maladaptive or just not very helpful. For example, if someone held the belief “failure is terrible and absolute” then, if they ever experienced any minor failure in their lives, the meaning that that schema might prompt the person to extract from that situation could be that they are a failure as a person. 

Beck and Clark argue that these negative and dysfunctional schemas lead people to pretty black and white negative beliefs about themselves, the world and the future. This is sometimes referred to as Beck’s **cognitive triad**.



One of the interesting things about schemas is that, when they’re activated, they change how we perceive the world. They create what the authors term a **“systematic cognitive bias”**. Activated negative schemas are a bit like the black cloud hanging over you that makes everything around you seem dark. When activated, they literally change the way that we perceive the world around us. They do this in a number of different ways.

It can affect which stimuli we pay attention to in the outside world. For example, people with depression respond faster to negative stimuli like sad faces and sad words than they do to happy stimuli. The sad stimuli captures their attention much, much faster. This is called **attention bias.** Some other research suggests that the interpretation of stimuli is also negatively biased when people are experiencing symptoms of depression. For example, one study showed people with and without a history of depression pictures of neutral faces [image]. These were images where people had no overt expression on their faces but people with a history of depression interpreted these faces as being sad. This is called …??? And the negativity really is all encompassing. Even the valence of people’s current mood influences the valence of memories they recall. This is called **memory bias.**



So, if schemas can affect us in such a negative way, then why do we have schemas at all? Well, when the schemas are formed so that they accurately represent the world around us, then schemas can be pretty useful. They allow us to do what’s known as **automatic appraisals.** These are mental shortcuts that save cognitive resources and allow us to make quick judgements. This is necessary in a threatening situation so that we can respond rapidly. Without these automatic appraisals, we’d have to rely on a different system that Beck and Clark refer to as the **Cognitive control system**. Where the automatic appraisal system is quite reflexive, the cognitive control system is slower and more evaluative. It allows us to reappraise situations, think about and weigh up alternatives. If you’re familiar with some psychology terms the authors consider that problem solving and executive functions are a part of this system. But the cognitive control system is much more mentally demanding and effortful. It’s also suppressed during a depressive episode.

So, how do negative schemas get formed? People with moderate to severe depression are more likely to have experienced significant traumatic events early in their life, like the loss of a parent. According to Beck and Clark, the effect of these early negative experiences is the creation of enduring attitudes and those attitudes create feelings like helplessness and hopelessness if similar types of experiences ever happened again. And indeed the authors found evidence that those events like early loss made the person more vulnerable to depression if they then experienced another loss later on in their life. They call this effect **Cognitive vulnerability** and it’s been seen in people of all ages from children to adolescents to adults.

More recent research suggests that in vulnerable individuals, less severe events can also trigger depressive episodes too. In addition, the authors found that this cognitive vulnerability appears to be progressive in the sense that progressively less aversive events can trigger subsequent episodes.

I mentioned right at the start of this lecture that the authors recognise that cognitions are not an island all on their very own. They obviously interact with physiological and biological components too. So, how do they do this?

Well, one way that the authors propose that negative schemas are formed is when a person has a genetic disposition that causes certain brain structures like the amygdala to become hyperactive. The amygdala is a pair of almond shaped structures deep in the brain and it plays a really big role in emotions like sadness. Another biological predisposition that people can inherit is an underactive prefrontal cortex. Now, remember that the prefrontal cortex is involved in those cognitive control activities like weighing up different alternatives and reappraisal. Beck and Clark argue that an inherited tendency for the prefrontal cortex to be a bit sluggish is that the person experiences “diminished cognitive appraisal”.

An overactive stress response can also play a really big role in depression and the authors speculate that it may also contribute to the formation of dysfunctional schemas. Some people will have a inherited predisposition to release lots of stress hormones when they’re in a challenging situation. This is called **hypercortisolemia**. Now, we won’t get into the fine details because they’re really complex, but when the body is flooded with too much cortisol over and over again, it can disrupt other chemicals in the body including serotonin which we know plays a role in regulating our moods.

Serotonin levels can also be disrupted in a more roundabout way too. What many people don’t realise is that serotonin gets transported on little structures called serotonin transporters. Now there are different variants of the gene that codes for these serotonin transporters. Some of the variants code for long serotonin transporters and another variant of the gene codes for short serotonin transporters. 

Think of these transporters a bit like trucks. Some people have a whole fleet of just long trucks, some people have a mixed fleet of long and short trucks and other people have only got short trucks. I want you to pause the video and write down what you think the implications of having a whole fleet of long trucks, so all long serotonin transporters, versus only having access to short trucks. How would this affect serotonin transportation and in turn, how might that affect someone’s mood? Pause the presentation and jot down some ideas.

So, as you might have guessed, just like a long truck, the long serotonin transporters can carry much, much more serotonin. Having access to more serotonin means that people with two copies of the long serotonin transporter allele gives them some emotional protection if they ever experienced a serious adverse event in their lives. On the other hand, people with two copies of the short serotonin transporter allele are much more likely to experience a major depressive episode after a significant life stressor.

What’s interesting too is that, even in children who have only short serotonin transporters, even when they’re not clinically depressed, they are more likely to evaluate themselves negatively when their mood is low.

Ok so how does the activation of a dysfunctional schema actually translate to a major depressive episode?

Well, according to this model, like we’ve already said, the activated schemas influence the **appraisal** of stressful life events. And those life events can be big or small. And I think that we as science communicators can often focus so much on those big life stressors like losing a loved one or losing a job, that we tend to gloss over the effect that smaller everyday stressors plays. When Clark and Beck reviewed the literature they found that “the daily negative appraisals of daily stressors predicted daily depressive symptoms.” What they’re saying is that people who appraise everyday stressors in a negative way are more likely to feel symptoms like low mood more often. And what’s more, the tendency to react negatively to everyday stressors is strongly associated with an increased risk of depression. So how does this happen?

Well, according to the model, the negative life event or lots of smaller events, activates the dysfunctional schemas. Once the schema has been activated, it skews the person’s information processing. Their attention, memory and interpretation of ambiguous events is all negative too, so the person’s lived experience becomes negatively skewed as well. This global cognitive bias towards negativity leads to those recognizable symptoms of depression like sadness, hopelessness and withdrawing from society. This in turn leads to negative evaluations about what all this means. The authors use example phrases like “My poor functioning is a burden on my family” and “My loss of motivation shows how lazy I am.”

One of the side effects of repeated activation of depressive schemas is that they become hypersensitive so, increasingly less stressful events can trigger the depressive episode. This is because repeated activation of those maladaptive schemas makes the maladaptive processing more ingrained and easily triggered. It’s almost like the pessimism starts becoming the person’s default setting. 

Now, just like every other model that we’ve discussed so far, Beck and Clark acknowledge that this model is not all encompassing. It’s not the full story. Some of the future work they’d like to see to develop their model is for other scientists to integrate the information that has been gathered from areas such as genetics, neurosciences and social psychology.

This integration of established scientific knowledge is, in my mind at least, how science makes its biggest leaps.

Thanks for watching! In this lecture we talked about the cognitive model of depression. We discussed how Beck and Clark conceptualise depression with maladaptive schemas at the heart. They outline how these schemas influence how we appraise ourselves and the world around us and how this negative appraisal can lead to the symptoms characteristic of a major depressive episode. We also covered how the repeated activation of negative schemas can make them hypersensitive to future activation and could explain the recurrent depressive episodes seen in major depressive disorder.

In the next lecture we’ll talk about one aspect that Beck and Clark virtually neglect in all of their discussions; behaviour. Catch you next time when we talk about the Behavioural Activation model of depression.



### the behavioural activation model

In the 1990’s, a research team led by Neil Jacobson analysed some of their CBT data. What they found was really interesting. These researchers found that it’s not just our thoughts but also our behaviour that can play a really important role in helping people with depression get better. 

They flipped this idea on its head and deduced that, if behaviour is important for getting better then maybe behaviour plays a role in why people *don’t* get better. Maybe behaviour contributes to the maintenance of depression. Let’s take a look at the behavioural activation model of depression.

Now the idea that behaviour plays an important role in depression wasn’t entirely new, it just wasn’t the mainstream idea. There have actually been behavioural models of depression ever since Skinner’s time [image]. But after Aaron Beck put forward his cognitive model in the 60’s, the role of behaviour in depression was really put on the back burner.

A decade later in 1973, Charles Ferster noted that people with depression display an increase in **escape/avoidance** type behaviours. Remember we spoke about these behaviours before in the context of anxiety. Recall that escape and avoidance behaviours are driven by **negative reinforcement**.

One point that is really important to highlight in negative reinforcement is that the behaviour, so that escape/avoidance behaviour, that behaviour is *always* prompted by something aversive. So, something aversive is going on and then the escape or avoidance behaviour terminates the aversive stimulus. The behaviour makes the bad things stop.

Now, what can we deduce from this? Well, Ferster worked out that if depressed people are showing lots of escape and avoidance type behaviours then that means they’re experiencing lots of aversive events in their lives too. And remember this is what the statistics on depression show.

We already saw that life stressors were both risk factors and catalysts for depression.

And, as Jacobson points out, 20-55% of adults will demonstrate at least mild depressive symptoms at some point in their lives. Supporters of behavioural models of depression argue that biological factors alone - so things like genetics - they don’t explain this high rate or the fact that a person’s risk of depression fluctuates as they move through different life stages or different circumstances. Instead, the behavioural activation models of depression argue that the environments we experience play a big role in determining who develops depression and also, at what time in the person’s life the depression occurs. Looking at the demographics of who develops depression gives us an insight into this point (recap) – and, when a major depressive episode occurs, it’s usually after a significant, stressful life event.

The other thing that Ferster noted in the 70’s is that depressed people also show a decrease in behaviours that would provide **positive reinforcement**. These are behaviours that people would just naturally find rewarding like going for a walk, watching a beautiful sunset, hanging out with friends, going to the movies, reading books just for fun, gardening, or maybe playing dress ups with kids! Think about an activity that you like doing just because it brings you joy; these are the types of behaviours that people with depression are doing less of. 

What Ferster pointed out is that this means people with depression are getting less *functional reinforcement* in their day to day lives. We’ll come back to this point in a moment.

In contrast to the cognitive models, the behavioural activation model argues that behavioural factors drive and maintain depression. So, what are these behaviours? What do they look like? Well, like DSM describes, these models argue that the behaviours of depression are **avoidance**, **withdrawal** and **inactivity**. And interestingly, although the role of avoidance was firmly established in anxiety, with the exception of a few researchers like Ferster, this aspect was largely overlooked in the context of depression until the late 90’s.

So, how do avoidance, withdrawal and inactivity drive and maintain depression? Well, to work all that out we have to do what’s known as a **functional analysis** of behaviour.

**Functional reinforcers and functional punishers** are really the cornerstones to behavioural perspectives. Put simply, behaviourists argue that pretty much all behaviours continue to be performed day after day because something is maintaining them. Functional reinforcers make the person feel good when they perform the behaviour, so the person performs that behaviour more in the future.

And remember that these functional reinforcers can either be positive reinforcement, like going to see a movie with a friend, or they can be negative reinforcing, like calling in sick because you feel overwhelmed with your workload. In both of these situations the person feels better as a result of their actions but in the positive reinforcement scenario the movie is added to the situation whereas in the negative reinforcement scenario the excessive work demands are taken away, temporarily!

Jacobson and co have formalised this functional analysis in what they call the TRAP model. The TRAP model aims to identify the stimuli and behaviours that trigger and maintain depressive episodes. 

First, we look at the **Trigger**. What is the environmental or contextual stimulus that initiates the episode? In this example they’ve used excessive demands at work.

The **Response** they describe is similar to the cognitive and physiological components of emotion that we’ve been discussing. These could be things like low mood or feeling hopeless.

The behavioural components are what they call the **Avoidance Pattern**. This is where the person makes themselves temporarily feel better by staying home from work, staying in bed or not answering their phone. Because these avoidance behaviours provide immediate relief from the discomfort, they get negatively reinforced, so the person is more likely to perform these avoidance behaviours again in the future.

The avoidance behaviours unfortunately often create secondary problems such as poor attendance at work or school which then exacerbates the contextual problems. In the work example, the person’s poor attendance might anger their boss or their colleagues or maybe the amount of work that needs to be done just piles up even more.

Another aspect of this avoidance is that the person’s behaviour is not actually addressing the cause of their low mood. The avoidance behaviours aren’t creating enduring change in their situation, so that aversive situation is just going to continue day after day.

And look, it’s really important to acknowledge that there are many cases where the person either can’t change their situation, or they’ve tried to change their circumstances but it didn’t work, or the processes required to make that enduring change just adds to the feelings of overwhelm and hopelessness. Poverty is just one example of this. 

One of the other side effects of avoidance and withdrawal is that it narrows the person’s behavioural range. Essentially, the pattern of avoidance becomes so frequent that it prevents the person from getting out and doing the activities that they find enjoyable.  So, not only is person withdrawing from aversive situations, they’re now withdrawing from lots of other situations and activities too. In turn, this low level of activity then minimises their opportunities to find functional reinforcement in their environments.

And so you can see that depression gives this double whammy of an awful situation that triggers the low mood and avoidance behaviours and then that avoidance compounds their low mood when it prevents them from doing enjoyable activities and obtaining functional reinforcement.

What Jacobson and co really want to highlight in the TRAP model is that behavioural activation looks for situational “causes” of depression. These authors say that, rather than viewing depression as an illness or a “defect” in the person’s biology or their thinking, *they* view depression as a product of the situation. And it’s not that they deny the roles of cognitive and biological factors, they just see these factors as an adjunct to the person’s situation. For these researchers, it’s not a personal characteristic that triggered the depression, it was the environment. Essentially, if the bad situation hadn’t happened, then the person wouldn’t have developed depression.

To quote:

“In BA [behavioural activation], it is assumed that the interaction of negative life circumstances and the client’s difficulty changing these circumstances may lead to the passivity often seen with depressed clients.”

If you’re familiar with Learned Helplessness, these are the same sorts of mechanisms that the authors are referring to. The person learns that they can’t change their circumstances, so they give up trying.

“It is not that passive people become depressed, but repeated punishment or a life that functions primarily on a negative reinforcement schedule establishes behavior patterns that compete with behaviors more likely to result in positive reinforcement from the environment.” 

To summarise, this model proposes that depression results from either repeated inescapable punishment or repeated negative reinforcement that prevents alternative positively reinforcing behaviours.

We’ve now looked at both the cognitive model and the behavioural activation model. So, which model is right? Well, just like the models of anxiety disorders that we’ve spoken about, both of these models have utility. One of the contexts where they are both frequently used is in therapy. The cognitive model has provided the basis of cognitive therapy and the behavioural activation model has informed behavioural activation therapy. Aspects of both are also used in cognitive behavioural therapy. We’ll discuss therapy in a little bit detail more next week.

Thanks for watching!

Today we’ve covered the behavioural activation model of depression. We worked through a functional analysis and talked about the types of reinforcement, or lack of reinforcement, that can be present in depression.

Take care and I’ll see you next week.
