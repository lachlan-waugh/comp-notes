## Fear and anxiety

* Their purpose is to keep us safe



### Symptons of anxiety

* Heart pounding
* Lightheaded, shaking hands
* Worrying about future events (what if)
* Avoidance behaviours
* Seeking reassurance



### State vs trait emotions

* State: short-lived, in response to an event
* Trait: long-lived, pattern happening regularly (traits/characteristics)
* Ongoing emotions may not be a disorder, e.g. fear in warzone



### Disorders

* Number of criteria to be problematic (according to DSM5)
  1. Persistent: at least 6 months (some exceptions e.g. panic disorder)
  2. Unreasonable: excessive compared to normal person in that **culture and circumstances**
  3. Impairment: causes significant distress or impairs functioning



### Who does it affect

* At least 1/4 people experience anxiety disorder in their life
* In a 12 month period, as many as 1/7 currently experiencing
  * Around 1/4 of those people have co-morbitity (co-occurence of an mood disorder e.g. depression on top of anxiety)
  * 3.6% of the population experience both anxiety and depression in a 12-month period
* Woman are more likely to be diagnosed
* Anxiety disorder likely to begin late teen years
  * Social anxiety -> 13
  * Generalized anxiety -> early thirties
* On average people miss 4.5 days of work/study per month
* 1/3 of people with anxiety disorder report high - very high levels of psychological distress



### Bio-psycho-social model

* Some component of heritability (genetic risk)
* Physiology plays a role, PSNS is too eager to return to homeostasis (blood pressure drops too much, too fast, lose consciousness)
  * Blood-injection-injury type: fear of needles/medical procedures
  * Vasovagal syncope: a biological tendency to faint
  * Respiratory disorders might elevate risk for panic disorders



### Associative learning

* Meta-analysis: scientist looks at results of many experiments, and looks at the overall trends
* People with anxiety might acquire fears more readily, and take longer to lose them



## How are they similar

* Stimulus
* Cognitive features: negative thinkings plays a role in development, maintenance of both mood and anxiety disorders (worry)
  * Worry involves verbal thoughts and imagery, focus on uncertain/negative outcomes that might happen in the future
  * Tend to **overestimate** the **likelihood** and **result** of the negative outcome; and **underestimate our ability to cope**.



### Anxiety disorders 

* Anxiety disorder vs dimensional model: anxiety disorder sees the same symptons, but last longer, occur more frequently.
* Some anxiety disorders more heavily associated with one emotion
  * Generalized anxiety -> anxiety (and hypervigilence)
  * Other ones -> fear (and fight/flight response)
* General avoidance (intolerance) of uncertainty
* Avoidance can continue even after extinction learning (people no longer fear the stimulus, but still avoid it)



### Panic attacks

* A sudden, intense fear that peaks within around 10 minutes (last 30)
* Transdiagnostic feature: they can happen in any mental disorder, or even without a disorder
* Anxiety, fear, and panic aren't inherently pathological, only when chronic
* **Cognitive symptons**: Fear of dying, losing control, or going crazy
  * Blood moving away from intensines and surface of skin can give the upset stomach, or odd temperature, numbness sensation
  * During a fight response, the body sweats a lot. Defense mechanism to help you escape, and to cool you down (but can give chills).
  * Breathing affected (deeper/faster, more oxygen), hyperventilation can make you short of breath, dizzy, or faint
  * Trembling -> increase in muscle tone
  * Pupil dillation -> feelings of altered reality, detatched from yourself
  * Can end with people feeling exhausted.




### Safety behaviours

* Like a safety blanket: letr you face a feared stimulus, but only when you have that certain object, or performed a certain behaviour



### Reassurance seeking and checking

* Attempt to neutralize anxiety/uncertainty (asking parents over and over if they're sure it's safe)



## How are they different

* Behaviours of different anxiety disorders can look similar, instead look at difference in stimulus, content of fear, or difference in cognitions



### Examples

* **Separation anxiety**: Fear of being separated from an attachment figure, or fearing harm is happening to that person
  * Common in kids, can occur in adults with spouses
* **Selective mutism**: Failure to speak in social situation
  * Mostly seen in children
* **Specific phobias**: An intense fear of a specific object or situation
* **Social anxiety**: fear of being negatively evaluated by others
* **Panic disorder**: fear of panic attack symptons
* **Agoraphobia**: fear of situtaions which might prompt a panic attack, where it may be difficult to leave or get help
* **Generalized anxiety**: a range of fears/worries about multiple stimuli.



### OCD and PTSD

* Both feature fear and anxiety heavily 
* Separated from other anxiety disorders in the most recent DSM.
  * OCD characterised by obsessions and compulsions
  * PTSD relates to a traumatic experience



### Illness anxiety disorder

* A fear of having or acquiring a serious illness
* Not an anxiety disorder
* Part of the 



## Specific phobias

* 3-15% of people meet the criteria at some point in their lives
* Fear is a central feature
* Threat is specific and immediate (generally the stimulus is present, rather than just the thought of it being in the future)



### Cognitions

* Content of thoughts focus on threats the stimulus poses to their physical or psychological well-being
* Lazarus (1991): "immediate, concrete, and overwhelming physical danger"
* People also think about the severity of the threat



### Physiological symptons

* General autonomic arousal
  * Increased heart rate, unless the person is experiencing fear bradycardia, increased blood-pressure, dilated pupils
  * Blood supply being diverted away from non-essential functions like digestion and into the skeletal muscles
  * Sweating.
* Attention, judgement and memory resources are all directed towards the threat.
* Fear of direct threat, rather than anxiety/hypervigilence of possible threat



### Behaviours

* More likely to experience escape-type behaviours



### Phobias

* Must be persistent, excessive, and cause significant distress
* Tend to cluster in subtypes
  * Animal: spider/dog
  * Natural environment: heights, storm, water
  * Blood injection-injury type: needles, invasive medical procedures
  * Situation: aeroplanes, elevastors, enclosed spaces
  * Other: choking, vomioting, load sounds/costumed characters (kids)



### Mowrer's Dual Process Model of Avoidance

* Two stage process of aquiring and maintaining fear
  * **Acquired** through classical conditioning
  * **Maintained** by negative reinforcement
* Negative reinforcement is bad, as we never learn that the stimulus isn't threatening



### Counter points

* Not all stimuli will develop phobias
  * Natural ones not taught through preparedness theory
  * Something you have a lot of good experiences with
* Negative reinforcement is a really powerful type of learning, avoidance behaviour can still exist after fear of stimulus is removed.
* The avoidance behaviour has become a **habit/reflex**.



## Generalised anxiety disorder

* Anxiety and worry about a number of different concerns
* Worry feels uncontrollable
* Physiology is anxious apprehension
  * restless and on edge, fatigued
  * lack of concentration, mind going blank
  * Irritability, muscle tension, difficult with sleep
* GAD requires persistence, excessive (given circumstances), distress and impairment, other causes must be ruled out.



### Worry

* A chain of thoguht and images negatively affect-laden and relatively uncontrollable
* Cognitions starts with a what if
  * intended to be helpful by preparing you
  * End up being unhelpful, prevents reasonable decisions



### Modality of thoughts

* Verbal thoughts illicit less emotional response than imagery
* Thought's occur in different modality's
  * Verbal/linguistic thoughts
  * Imagery based thoughts



### Avoidance model of worry (Borkovec Avoidance Theory)

* We perceive worry to be helpful, and use them to avoid negative imagery, but this avoidance from confronting and emotionally processing the initial fears (we never face them)
* Experiment of people imagining themselves doing something stressful
  * Imagery group had elevated cardiovascular state
  * Verbal group showed little change

* When negative imagery pops up, we jump to verbal thoughts to avoid it
  * The verbal worry is negatively reinforced




### Positive metacognitions

	* Meta-cognitions: thoughts about thoughts
	* Positive: the idea that worry is good (prevents bad things)



### Meta-cognitive model

* Worry can be a strategy to cope with stressful stimulus
  * Type 1 worry is things in the real worry
  * Type 2 worry is worry about worry (from negative meta-cognitions about the worry)
* Try to suppress the type 1 worry with distractions, avoidance, push it out, replace it with other thoughts
* Negatively reinforce the avoidance



### Intolerance of uncertainty model

* Four main areas driving worry
  1. **Intolerance of uncertainty**: Uncertain situations are inherently aversive and perceived as threatening or undesirable, regardless of possibility of the bad thing happening
  2. Positive meta-cognitions of worry
  3. **Negative problem orientation**: negative beliefs about problems, and ability to solve them (low confidence)
  4. Cognitive avoidance: avoiding negative content (esp. mental images and thoughts)



## Panic disorder

* A fear of having panic attacks



### Panic attacks

* Symptoms associated with fight or flight
  * Elevated heart rate, Rapid breathing, Trembling shaking
  * Sensations of Choking, Sweating
  * Nausea, Chills, Dizzy
  * Feelings of unreality, loosing control, fear of dying
* Don't mean someone has a disorder



### Characteristics

* Recurring panic attacks, that come out of the blue
* Afraid of having panic attacks, and what they may lead to
* Could believe panic attacks may lead to something more sinister (heart attack, going crazy, losing control)
* Results in a change in behaviour to avoid having more panic attacks
* Could avoid things resulting in panic attacks exercise, or unfamiliar situations
* Causes: Many symptoms of panic disorder can overlap with other issues (thyroid, substance use, caffeine)



### Agoraphobia: fear and avoidance of certain situations

* About avoiding situations, enduring situations with distress, only facing with someone there
* Types: public transport, being in open/enclosed places, being outside of home alone
* Originally believed to be fear of situations that may cause panic attacks where you cannot escape
* Not true for all people, can just be embarrassing or incapacitating symptoms (fall, incontinence)
* Originally DSM agoraphobia wasn't it's own illness, only in absence of panic disorder. Now separate
* 1/2 of people with agoraphobia didn't show any symptoms of panic attacks
* Statistical analysis showed the two had different profiles of disturbances (men vs women)



### Clark's cognitive model of panic

* Driving feature of panic disorder is the misinterpretation of physiological symptoms of panic as being dangerous
* Some symptoms of panic attacks are normally experienced throughout daily life (e.g. heart racing)
* Three stage process
  * Trigger stimulus
  * Threat perception
  * Physiological changes in body
* Catastrophic misinterpretation of sensations
* This can mean normal experiences result in safety seeking behaviours
  * Relief is only in short-term, but convinces you that avoidance is the only way to avoid it



### Behaviour and cognitions

* Bad outcomes (e.g. heart attack) never experienced due to escape behaviour
* Agoraphobia -> avoid movie theatre
* Panic disorder -> avoiding exercise



## Transcripts

### Introduction      

Have you ever felt fearful? What about anxiety? Have you ever felt anxious?
Virtually everyone on the planet has felt these two emotions at some point in their lives. But at what point do the emotions of fear and anxiety start to look like an anxiety disorder? In this lecture we’ll consider these two emotions and see if we can answer that question.

So, first up, here’s a little infographic about the symptoms of anxiety. Let's have a look and think about whether you’ve ever experienced any of these things. 

Have you ever felt your heart pounding, felt lightheaded, or noticed that your hands are shaking? What about worrying about future events or thinking “what if”? What about those avoidance behaviours we spoke about in the last lecture? Have you ever avoided something unpleasant? And what about seeking reassurance from people around you? Have you ever done that?

Chances are that we all recognise at least some of the things up on the screen. Why is that? Well, fear and anxiety are actually completely normal and healthy emotions to feel from time to time. Remember what we said about them before? The purpose of fear and anxiety is to keep us safe. So, the question is, if its healthy to feel these from time to time, at what point do they start looking like a disorder?

One way that psychologists have conceptualised this is to make a distinction between state vs trait emotions. Essentially, state emotions are short lived and happen in response to some event, whereas trait emotions are more long lived; you get a pattern of these emotions happening regularly and they
start to look a bit more like traits or characteristics.

If you saw the movie Inside/Out, a way to think about state vs trait might be the difference between the character Sadness driving just some of the time versus Sadness driving Riley constantly. But really, the distinction isn’t that simple. We can’t just look at how long an emotion persists for and then decide that this person’s got a disorder.

For example, consider people living in war zones, or people of persecuted minorities. There are lots of situations where we might expect people to experience unpleasant emotions like fear and anxiety on an ongoing basis. And in these cases, it might even be adaptive for them to do so. Remember that the purpose of fear and anxiety is to protect people from harm. So, these emotions may help protect this person from the ongoing danger that they’re experiencing. So, simply having on going fear and anxiety doesn’t necessarily mean that the person has a disorder. 

Ok, so what other things can we consider?
Well, according to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, symptoms need to meet a number of criteria to be considered problematic.

1. Firstly, the symptoms need to be persistent, so for most disorders the criteria require that the symptoms have hung around for at least 6 months.There are some exceptions, for example, panic disorder and some childhood occurrences which have different criteria.
2. Secondly, the symptoms need to be excessive or unreasonable, beyond what you’d expect for a person in that culture and in that person’s circumstances. To quote DSM-5 the symptoms are NOT attributable to “An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss...”
3. And finally, the symptoms need to cause significant distress or impair functioning. The symptoms get in the way of important things like school, work, or social activities. DSM states this as “...significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities.”

Now, the actual symptoms involved in various disorders differ. It’s not just as simple as having fear or anxiety that is persistent, excessive, and disruptive. We’ll describe symptoms for some disorders more specifically next week, but just keep these fundamental concepts in mind: persistent, excessive or
unreasonable, and distress or impairment.

Ok, so if we keep those things in mind, how common are anxiety disorders? Unfortunately, quite common. As many as 1 in 4 people will experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their life. And within a 12 month period, as many as 1 in 7 people will currently be experiencing an anxiety disorder. It’s important to know as well, that around a quarter of those people will have what we call a comorbidity which is co-occurrence of an affective mood disorder, such as depression, on top of the anxiety disorder. What this
means is that around 3.6% of the population is likely to experience both an anxiety disorder and an affective disorder within a given twelve month period. That’s a lot. If you think about 100 friends on your social media list, statistically, 14 of them will experience an anxiety disorder this year, and 3-4 of those will be unlucky enough to have a mood disorder like depression as well. [ABS National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (2007), reported in The Mental Health of Australians 2 (Slade, Johnston, Teeson, Whiteford, Burgess, Pirkis, Saw, 2009)

So, who gets anxiety disorders? And how old are they, usually? Firstly, we know that women are much more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. We also know that anxiety disorders are likely to begin in the late teen years, but this does vary a bit depending on the disorder. For instance, social anxiety, has a median age of onset of 13 years of age, whereas generalized anxiety disorder tends to have an onset in the early thirties.
We also know that anxiety disorders can have a huge impact on peoples’ lives. We can see here that quite a number of people living with these disorders report severe impacts on their home life, work, study, relationships, and social lives.

Looking at work or study more closely, we can see that for people living with these disorders, on average they will miss 4 and a half days of work or study per month because of their symptoms. And so you can see that anxiety disorders really get in the way of them performing their role.

So, what’s the emotional impact of anxiety disorders? We’ve got here the average responses to a distress questionnaire, and we can see that around a third of people living with an anxiety disorder are reporting high or very high levels of psychological distress.

Hopefully by now, you’re getting a sense of just how common anxiety disorders are and just how disruptive they can be to people’s lives.
So, if anxiety disorders are really prevalent, disabling and distressing, then what’s causing all this? What causes anxiety disorders?

Well, this is difficult to answer because there isn’t a single identifiable cause for anxiety disorders. Instead, there are a number of risk factors that can add up and interact to increase someone’s likelihood of experiencing an anxiety disorder. Now, that doesn’t mean that people with these risk factors will
definitely develop an anxiety disorder, it just means that these factors are associated with an elevated risk.

We can group risk factors into different sectors using the bio-psycho-social model. So, under biological factors, we know from twin studies that there is some component of heritability. There’s a genetic risk. So, having a family member with an anxiety or mood disorder elevates your risk of experiencing an anxiety or mood disorder too.

We also know that physiology can play a role for some disorders. For instance, there’s this one type of specific phobia called blood-injection-injury type phobia where people fear things like needles or medical procedures. Well, we know that people with this disorder often have a biological tendency to faint, like vasovagal syncope. So, for these people, when they see something traumatic like an injury, it’s like their parasympathetic nervous system is a bit too eager to return them to homeostasis. Their blood pressure drops too much, too fast and they get to the point where they are more likely to lose consciousness. There is also some evidence that respiratory disorders might elevate risk for panic disorder.

With psychological factors, we know that some broad personality factors such as neuroticism might play a role in people’s risk of developing an anxiety disorder. We also know that more specific psychological factors play a role too. As we mentioned right at the beginning of the lecture, the psychological process of worry plays a role. That’s probably not surprising and we’ll unpack that more in a later lecture.

In terms of associative learning, a really interesting finding came out of a large meta-analysis from 2005. A meta-analysis is where a scientist looks at the results of lots of different experiments and they see what the overall trends have been. Anyway, this meta-analysis suggested that people with anxiety disorders might have a propensity to acquire fears more readily, so for instance they might acquire classically conditioned fear at a faster rate than other people. This study also suggested that people with anxiety disorders might be slower experience extinction of their fears compared to people without these disorders.

Remember how Mary Cover Jones presented Peter with the white rabbit over and over again until he wasn’t afraid? Well, this study suggests that people with anxiety disorders might take longer to experience that extinction learning than other people. In terms of social and environmental factors, we know life stressors and traumatic events can increase risk for some disorders, and there’s even some evidence that parental overprotectiveness can increase a child’s risk for separation anxiety and specific phobias



### How are they similar

Hi everyone, today we’ll taking a transdiagnostic approach to anxiety disorders, so we’ll be looking at some of the common characteristics that pop up across anxiety disorders.

So first up, the stimulus. You should all know by now that the stimulus for fear and anxiety involve some sort of real or imagined threat, and that is definitely the case for anxiety disorders, although the specific nature of the threat does vary between disorders and we’ll talk about that in our next lecture on differences.

Next up are cognitive features. This is actually what our other lecturer Ann Martin is focusing on in her PhD! So, there’s really good evidence that repetitive negative thinking plays a key role in the development and the maintenance, or continuation, of both mood and anxiety disorders.

We’ll talk more about mood disorders later in the term, but in terms of anxiety disorders, this repetitive negative thinking is what we know as worry. Worry can involve verbal thoughts and also imagery. And generally, worry focuses on uncertain or negative outcomes that might happen in the future [animation].

There are some common patterns in the content of these thoughts too, where we tend to overestimate how likely it is that something bad will happen, and just how bad it would be if that thing did come true. We also tend to underestimate our ability to cope if that bad outcome does happen. 

So, we know that this type of thinking is very common across the anxiety disorders and, like I said before, it actually plays a role in its development and also the continuation of the disorder. In psychology, we call this the
maintenance of the disorder. In terms of the physiology of anxiety disorders, we tend to see the same changes that we’ve talked about with fear and anxiety as emotions.

So, think back to that dimensional model of defense cascade. Remember we saw things like hypervigilance and the fight or flight response. Well, in anxiety disorders we tend to see these same symptoms but in a much more ongoing way. So, they might last longer, or they might occur much more frequently.

While we’re talking about the physiological components and fear versus anxiety, it’s worth noting that some anxiety disorders can be more heavily associated with one emotion versus the other.

For example, it has been suggested that generalized anxiety disorder may feature the emotion of anxiety more prominently along with its corresponding components like hypervigilance. On the other hand, specific phobias may feature the emotion fear more prominently with the fight or flight response being triggered by the phobic stimulus.

While we’re talking about the fear cascade it's also worth talking about panic attacks. Panic attacks involve a cluster of symptoms relating to fight, flight or freeze response. Now, before we get into what panic attacks are, it’s important to note that panic attacks are a transdiagnostic feature. What this
means is that they can happen in any mental disorder, not just in panic disorder. Actually, you know what? Anyone can have a panic attack, even if they don’t meet the criteria for a mental disorder.

They’re one of those dimensional things that sits on a spectrum. They’re kind of like how anxiety and fear are normal, human emotions. Anxiety, fear and panic aren’t inherently pathological. It’s when these things start to become more chronic and meet those other criteria that we talked about, that’s when we may start to think twice.

Ok, so what is a panic attack then? Well, a panic attack is when you have a sudden surge of really intense fear that peaks within around ten minutes or so. There are a number of physical symptoms or feelings that map onto fight or flight symptoms, and I’ll talk about those parallels in a second, but
there’s also cognitive symptoms including fear of dying, losing control or going crazy.

Now, if we keep in mind the physiology of the fight or flight response then the physical symptoms that people feel during a panic attack are pretty understandable. So, remember how the fight or flight response makes the heart pump faster and harder to send blood and oxygen to important muscles? Well, this can give the feeling like your heart is pounding or like
you’re having heart palpitations.

Now, as that blood is diverted away from your intestines and the surface of your skin, you can feel upset in the tummy or get odd temperature sensations or even numbness or tingling as your circulation changes.

One of the interesting things that happens when our body prepares to fight is that we start to sweat. Like, a lot! And this sweating actually serves at least two main functions. Not only does all this sweat cool down quickly, it also makes you harder to grab a hold of! And in a threatening situation it can help
you escape. But one of the side effects is that you’ll feel sweaty and maybe also get chills.

During the fight/flight response, remember the body releases adrenaline and this can leave you shaky. But that trembling could actually also be related to an increase in muscle tone. In turn, this increase in muscle tone can also cause other sensations like a tightness or aching in the chest.

Remember that your breathing is affected during the fight or flight response. So, you breathe deeper and faster in order to have enough oxygen to supply your muscles. Paradoxically, this hyperventilation can make you feel short of breath or dizzy or faint if you aren’t actually active while you’re breathing deeper.

And with all these odd sensations, changes to oxygen levels reaching your brain, and things like pupil dilation that affects your vision, it’s probably unsurprising that during a panic attack you can experience feelings of altered reality or feeling detached from yourself.

So, there you go. Quite a lot can happen in your body when you experience a panic attack! Although they are generally short-lived experiences that peak within then minutes and last around half an hour, they often leave people feeling exhausted after all of those changes have gone on.

And finally, in terms of behavioural features, there are a number of things that we see across anxiety disorders. Given our discussions of avoidance and escape in relation to anxiety and fear, it probably won’t be surprising to hear that these behaviours feature in lots of different anxiety disorders.

One of the specific types of avoidance we see in lots of anxiety disorders is avoidance of uncertainty. Actually, a number of anxiety disorders are characterized by what we call intolerance of uncertainty.

What’s really interesting with avoidance, is that these behaviours can actually become quite automatic. It’s like we just get into the habit of avoiding things, so much so that avoidance behaviours can continue
even after extinction learning. What this means is that the person can get the point where they no longer fear the stimulus but they still perform the avoidance behaviour anyway.

We also see safety behaviours, remember these are like that behavioural safety blanket. Safety behaviours let you face a feared stimulus but, just like a safety blanket, you were only able to face that fear because you had a certain object with you or because you performed a certain behavior. So, an
example might be a child that’s afraid of dogs and will only walk past one if mum or dad are there to shield them.

Finally, we have reassurance seeking and checking behaviours. These behaviours are attempts to neutralize the anxiety or the uncertainty. For example, if child fears monsters at night, they might ask their parent over and over again, are they sure it’s safe? Or they might get their parent to check under the bed to make sure there aren’t any monsters



### How are they different

Phobias. Panic. Separation anxiety. Generalised Anxiety.

What makes each anxiety disorder unique? What sets each disorder apart from the others? Earlier this week, we were talking about the types of symptoms that appear in anxiety disorders a category. These are the things they have in common that tell us they belong in a category together; the
things that we see across anxiety disorders transdiagnostically, like escape or avoidance behaviours, for instance. Well, today we are going to talk a bit about the differences between the disorders.

We mentioned last lecture that, although the stimulus for anxiety disorders always involves threat, the nature of that stimulus can differ. This means that the content of the fear can differ too. We’ll delve into that in a moment.

One of the reasons that we usually look at differences in the stimulus, the content of the fear, or the differences in cognitions, is because the behaviours of different anxiety disorders can often look pretty similar.

For example, let's say a little Jimmy doesn’t want to go to his friend Marianne’s 7th birthday and avoids attending the party. Just looking at that avoidance behavior alone doesn’t really tell us what the stimulus is. There could be a million different things that Jimmy’s afraid of. It could be the social interaction that he is avoiding, or it could be separation from his parents, or maybe Marianne has a dog that he’s avoiding? Or maybe he just an introverted kid and doesn’t enjoy parties? Remember that just because a person is showing an avoidance behaviour does not mean that it’s pathological.

So, we can’t always tell what the stimulus is just by looking at the behaviour. What can we do instead? We can look at cognitions. Let's go through the anxiety disorders recognised in DSM-5, along with some very crude summaries of the key fear in each disorder, and we’ll see how the stimulus and cognitions differ between disorders.

So, we have separation anxiety, which is fear of being separated from an attachment figure or fearing that harm is going to happening to that person. This is quite common in kids with fears about their parents, but we do see it quite often in adults with their spouses too.

Selective mutism is another disorder that we see mostly in children, and it’s characterised by a failure to speak in social situations. And this behaviour can be related to social concerns.

For specific phobias, the person has an intense fear of a specific object or situation. I’m sure you can think of many examples for this!

In social anxiety, we have a core fear of being evaluated negatively by others.

For panic disorder we have a fear of panic attack symptoms.

And similarly, for agoraphobia, we have a fear of situations where you might have a panic attack and it might be hard to leave that situation or to get help.

And finally, we have generalized anxiety disorder. This is where you have a range of fears or worries about a number of different stimuli.

So, you can see that the core fears in each disorder can differ dramatically from really specific physical things, like a dog, to less tangible things like social evaluation or even sensations in your own body!

While we’re talking about DSM and anxiety disorders, it's worth mentioning that Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Post-traumatic stress disorder used to be lumped in with anxiety disorders because the emotions of fear and anxiety feature heavily in them. But the most recent diagnostic manual has separated them out. The reason that they were reclassified out of the anxiety disorders category is because more recent research has indicated that these two disorders are fundamentally different to the anxiety disorders.

So, OCD is different because it involves these characteristic obsessions and compulsions. PTSD is also different in that it always relates to a traumatic experience.

It’s also important to be aware of a disorder called Illness Anxiety Disorder. Now, despite its name, it isn’t classified within the anxiety disorders. Instead, it’s part of the somatic symptom disorders group because it involves a fear having or acquiring a serious illness.

Thanks for watching! In this lecture we took a brief look at how the fears and cognitions of different anxiety disorders differ from each other. We also mentioned that we can’t always tell what the person is afraid of simply by looking at their behaviour. This is why we need to look at other components like cognitions.

Next week, we're going to look at three of these disorders more closely: Specific Phobias, Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder.



### Specific phobias

Specific phobias. They’re one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders with studies reporting that 3-15% of people will meet the diagnostic criteria at some point in their lives. But what are phobias? We all feel fear, dislike or disgust towards certain objects and situations. And our previous lectures have outlined why this is can be adaptive. So, when does a fear become a phobia? Let’s find out.

I mentioned last week that some anxiety disorders overlap heavily with the emotion fear whereas other disorders overlap heavily with the emotion anxiety. Well, many researchers argue that for specific phobias, fear is a central feature. Ok, so what do I mean by this? What is it about specific phobias that makes the emotion of fear more relevant than, say, anxiety?
Let’s have a look at our components of emotion and see what’s going on.

Just like the name says, in specific phobias the stimulus is specific. It’s not usually the case that if a person fears needles for example that they also fear a whole bunch of animals, storms and confined spaces as well. The stimulus is usually pretty specific. The person’s symptoms are also provoked when the phobic stimulus is directly encountered. It’s not usually a future situation that is causing the discomfort, the trigger is right there in front of the person. This means that the threat associated with this disorder is immediate or even imminent. The stimulus is actually present. 

Look, I should mention that the symptoms can usually also be provoked when the person imagines a situation where they are being confronted with that stimulus too, and Ann will go into imagery-based cognitions in the next lecture but, for simplicity, we’re going to say that in both situations, the physical and the imagined, the threat is specific and immediate.

And what do we know happens when a person is confronted with a threat like this? All of the other components of emotion shift to match the immediate and specific nature of the stimulus.
[cognitions]

So, the cognitions relating to a specific, immediate stimulus, the content of a  person’s thoughts shifts to focus on the threat that this stimulus poses to their physical or psychological well-being. As Lazarus (1991) put it, the cognitions relate to an “immediate, concrete and overwhelming physical danger.” People can also think about how bad the threat is; its severity.

[physiological symptoms]
Remember what happens in the body when a person is confronted with a specific and immediate threat? If we think back to the post-encounter defense stage and also the circa-strike defense stage of Hamm’s fear cascade, what types of physiological reactions go on in the body when someone is confronted with a stimulus they perceive as threatening? Well, according to Hamm the exact changes will depend on both the proximity of the threat, so how close that particular threat is, but also the environmental
context, so if there’s an opportunity to escape or not.

But, overall, the types of physiological reactions we might expect include things like general autonomic arousal, increased heart rate, unless the person is experiencing fear bradycardia, increased blood-pressure, dilated pupils, blood supply being diverted away from non-essential functions like digestion and into the skeletal muscles, sweating. Attention, judgement and memory resources are all directed towards the threat.

Importantly, these physiological changes will relate to the fear of a direct threat rather than the anxiety and hypervigilance associated with a vague or potential future threat.

[behaviours]
In terms of the behaviours associated with specific phobias, we are more likely to observe escape-type behaviours. Remember that the phobic symptoms are usually triggered by an actual encounter with the stimulus so it makes sense that we would see that fear-driven escape behaviour. And again, admittedly, people with specific phobias may avoid situations where they know that they are likely to encounter phobic stimuli and usually we would associate avoidance with anxiety rather than fear.

So, for example, someone who is dog phobic might avoid coming over to my place because I’ve got two massive, bouncy dogs. Some may argue that it is the thought of that specific stimulus and how bad that situation would be that provokes the avoidance behaviour. Either way, we can see that the majority of the components are more closely associated with fear as opposed to anxiety but this is obviously not the entire story. And we shouldn’t expect it to be really.

We’re talking about real people with real fears so it may be unrealistic to expect them to fit into perfect little emotional boxes. These just seem to be the general trends that are found when looking at phobias as a whole. More fear, less anxiety. 

So, what do specific phobias looks like? As I said before, fear of a specific object or situation is the central feature but there may also be some situations where anxiety occurs too. The person reliably experiences those components of fear that we just spoke about and those components are always, or almost always, evoked immediately on presentation of the phobic stimulus. The other important feature is avoidance of that phobic stimulus.

So, escaping it if it’s seen or experienced or, if the person can’t escape or avoid it, the stimulus is endured with intense fear or anxiety depending on the proximity of the threat. 

Now, we all have things that we’re afraid of or situations that we really dislike. Once again, it’s important to remember the general concepts of mental disorders. The symptoms must be persistent, they must be excessive or unreasonable. Essentially, the fear response must be disproportionate to the actual threat.

Remember our green lollipop fear? Obviously, green lollipops don’t usually pose a mortal threat so flipping over a table and running out of the room is an excessive and culturally atypical response to that stimulus. But if you’re about to get eaten by a tiger then that response doesn’t seem excessive anymore. The symptoms must also cause clinically significant distress and or impairment. And, of course, other causes must be excluded, so medical conditions etc.

Something that researchers discovered very early on, is that phobias tend to cluster in subtypes. These subtypes are animal phobias (e.g. spiders, insects, dogs), phobias related to the natural environment e.g. heights, storms, water), the phobia we’ve briefly mentioned previously Blood-injection-injury (e.g. needles, invasive medical procedures), Situational phobias (e.g. aeroplanes, elevators, enclosed spaces), and the Other phobias category. This can be a phobia of things choking or vomiting, or in children, in particular, they may have a phobia of loud sounds or costumed characters.

Ok, so how do be acquire Specific Phobias and once they have that fear, why does it endure? What makes the fear continue? 

In Week 3 we had a look at this concept of associative learning. Remember that associative learning is that umbrella term that scientists use to describe both classical conditioning and instrumental conditioning. This is where we learn about our environment as well as the consequences of our actions.
And, with associative learning, we learn about these things first-hand. They’re not modelled, we’re not learning through instruction. We learn about the environment and the consequences of our actions first-hand.

So, you got a static electric shock from touching a car door handle on a windy day. Then you’re afraid to touch it again, in case the same bad experience happens again. And this car door handle example is really interesting because both forms of learning, classical and instrumental are occurring together.

[animation]

On the one hand we’ve got the typical classical conditioning paradigm where the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus after it’s been associated with the unconditioned stimulus of the electric shock. Remember that the unconditioned response would be pain and the conditioned response after that experience is fear. You’re afraid of the door handle because it predicts getting zapped!

Then, that fear begins driving your behaviour. The fear is driving your avoidance behaviour!

So, in terms of associative learning, what does that avoidance behaviour look like? Well, first up we’ve got something scary – the door handle. And our brain recognises that if we avoid the behaviour of interacting with that stimulus, then the bad thing doesn’t happen. The scary thing goes away.

Pause the video and write down what the technical term for this avoidance behaviour is. Honestly, do it. Press pause and write something down. It doesn’t matter if you get it wrong – prediction error is really powerful when it comes to learning, so just have a go!

Ok, hopefully you were brave and wrote down something. When we avoid a scary or uncomfortable stimulus or situation, and that avoidance behaviour makes us feel better, we’re more likely to do that avoidance behaviour again in the future, right? This is called negative reinforcement. It’s negative because something is taken away - the bad stuff goes away – and it’s reinforcing because we do that behaviour more in the future. We repeat the avoidance behaviour more in the future because it makes us feel better.

If you wrote down a different answer, please don’t worry or get upset with yourself. You’re learning. Prediction error is a normal part of the learning process, and we’ll come back to this point in a moment. One really important thing to note about negative reinforcement is that, for stimuli and situations that don’t pose a genuine threat to our lives, avoiding that situation unfortunately means that we can never really learn that that stimulus is not actually threatening. The stimulus might make you feel uncomfortable, but you’re not really in perilous danger.

Unfortunately, what the avoidance behaviour does, is stop the person from undergoing extinction learning. And if we think back to Mary Cover Jones, remember that she facilitated extinction learning by gradually exposing baby Peter to the white rabbit until he wasn’t afraid anymore.

The key part in extinction is that bad things, like pain, DON’T happen during this new learning phase. Like, a person or animal can only learn that a stimulus poses no threat if bad things don’t happen in the presence of the stimulus!

The more they experience the stimulus and then bad things DON’T happen, then the brain learns that this stimulus no longer predicts threat. If we think about the car door handle, yeah, we get a shock. But usually we only get one shock, and this grounds the static electricity, so the door handle isn’t dangerous anymore.

The reality of the situation is that, if we actually touched the door handle again, we would learn that it’s ok. There is no threat. It’s not going to give us another shock. This stimulus isn’t dangerous anymore. If we actually confront the stimulus, our brain goes, “Oh. That’s strange. That’s not what I thought would happen [prediction error]. I thought I was going to be in pain, but everything is ok. Maybe this stimulus isn’t actually threatening after all. Maybe I could try touching the door handle again.”

This is the process of extinction learning. Repeated exposure to a feared stimulus, without any aversive consequences, until the stimulus no longer triggers fear or anxiety.

Hopefully you can start to see this two-stage process of how fears can be acquired and then maintained.

First, our fears get acquired through classical conditioning and then, negative reinforcement drives those avoidance behaviours. This avoidance prevents extinction learning and so that negative reinforcement actually maintains the fear because the person never gets the opportunity to learn that the stimulus isn’t actually dangerous. They never get to undergo extinction learning and all the prediction error that comes along with it.

This whole process is Mowrer’s (1976) Dual-Process Model of Avoidance. It explains that, especially for things like phobias, the phobia can get acquired through classical fear conditioning and then that fear gets maintained through negative reinforcement.

Hopefully at least some of you will be putting your critical thinking hat on and saying, “Wait a minute. My neighbour’s half-brother's sister has a friend whose mum has a shoe phobia, but she’s never had a bad experience with a shoe before. What’s going on there?”

Glad you asked! Just like every other theory and model that we’ve spoken about so far in this course, the dual-process model doesn’t explain everything about phobias. We know that some people will develop phobias through other avenues such as modelling, verbal instruction and having a biological predisposition to fearing certain stimuli, like we see in preparedness theory.

We also know that sometimes people can have really bad experiences with certain stimuli and then not go on to develop phobias. Sometimes this is because the stimulus is not one of those natural stimuli that evolutionary preparedness allows us to rapidly fear. A child might stick a marble up their nose and have to go to hospital but then not fear marbles! Not developing a phobia can also be because the person has had lots of good experiences with that stimulus previously and they recognise that one bad experince as
an anomaly rather than the norm.

One of the other interesting things that runs contrary to Mowrer’s model is something I touched on briefly in a previous lecture. It’s not unheard for a person to undergo extinction learning, genuinely have no more fear towards a stimulus but then still perform the avoidance behaviour anyway. This happens because negative reinforcement is a very powerful type of learning. 

It takes a long time for this to happen but, if the avoidance behaviour is performed over and over and over again, it can eventually become what is known as a habit. You may be familiar with a term called “over-learning”. Same thing!

Habits occur, not because we’re motivated to avoid something bad but simply because our sensory system detects the environmental stimuli and then this sensory recognition automatically prompts the avoidance behaviour. You can see that with habits there’s no mention of any emotions in this process whatsoever. You’re not performing the behaviour with the goal of avoiding something bad, you’re performing it because that’s what you’ve done so many times in this situation. It’s no longer motivated
by instrumental or goal-directed processes, the behaviour is now an automatic habit - almost like a reflex – and it can happen without you even thinking about it!

Thanks for watching! In this lecture we covered what specific phobias are, how they relate to the components of emotion and how they seem more closely related to fear rather than anxiety. We also looked at Mowrer’s two-stage model of avoidance and used it to understand how phobias can develop and be maintained.

In the next lecture, Ann Martin is going to take you introduce you to a disorder that is most certainly related to anxiety. Tune in next time to learn about Generalised Anxiety Disorder.
