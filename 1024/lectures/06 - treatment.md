## Lecture 1

### scientist-practitioner model

* integration of scientific method with clinical practice
* practitioner adopts scientific method in general approach to clients
  * formulate range of hypotheses of diagnoses, factors maintaining disorder, treatment options based on evidence. Collect data to evaluate hypothesis (e.g. change in symptoms)



### evidence-based treatment

* select scientifically validated methods for assessment and treatment
  * e.g. evidence based interviews, validated questionnaires
  * these questions are asked in a certain way, and so that client isn't pressured to respond in a certain way
  * how a question is asked can impact its answer
* Randomised control trials: often used as evidence for treatments
* evidence-based intervention may be more difficult in the short-term, but have greater results in the long-term



### NHMRC

* Australian federal body which allocates funding, determines standards for scientific integrity and rigour.



### Dimensions of evidence

* **Strength of evidence**
  * **Level**: different study allow different levels of bias
  * **Quality of evidence**: design was executed, and bias controlled
  * **Statistical precision**: how confident can you be in the findings
* **Size of effect**: how much improvement did the treatment cause
* **Relevance of evidence:** what outcomes measure was used, is it relevant to the specific person (e.g. married treatment for single)



### Types of evidence

* **Case series**: a series of case studies to determine effects of intervention (measure symptoms before and after)
  * No control group to compare results
* **Historical controls**: results from current group compared to results from another group you treated previously.
  * different experimenters, selection requirements, cohort effects
* **Experimental/control groups, same experiment, participants not random**: e.g. participants choose their treatment (control or not)
* **Pseudo-randomized allocation**: e.g. alternating people as they walk in
* **Randomised controlled trials**: participants randomised, control group, variables controlled as much as possible.
* **Systematic reviews and meta-analyses**: only relevant randomized control trials are included in analysis



## Evidence based treatments



### Comparing treatments

* pharmacotherapy vs psychotherapy
* different classes or subtypes within those categories: two medications or talking therapies like CBT vs BA
* different modalities (individual vs group, f2f vs online)
* short vs long-term effects (6 months, 12 months, 2 years)



### Organisations

* **The Cochrane Collaboration**: Independent body to develop systematic reviews of strongest evidence for different healthcare interventions (e.g. mental disorders)
* **NICE**: UK government body supporting NHS (reviews treatment)
* Australian Psychological Society



### Effective treatments

* Anxiety: CBT and exposure theraphy
* GAD, panic, social anxiety: CBT
* Specific phobias: Exposure theraphy
* Depression: a range (BA, CBT, interpersonal theraphy, problem solving theraphy, acceptance and commitment therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and couples therapy). The best  were CBT, BA, and IPT



### CBT

* Talking theraphy targetting maintaining factors of in models of disorders
* Stages
  * **assessment**: diagnosis, and psychoeducation (teaches what is going on with their disorder e.g. maintaining factors), formulates individuals case and considers their content
  * **theraphy**: targets cognitive and behavioural components. this changes physiological components as well. still effects biology
    * **behavioural intervention**: could include exposure theraphy to reduce learned behaviours (extinction learning)
    * **behavioural experiments**: person challenges cognitive appraisals on their own. Not just exposure as there's a clear hypothesis
  * **relapse prevention**: identify factors that risk readopting avoidance behaviours, or thought patterns. How to manage these risks.



### Modalities

* Different modalities of theraphy are quite common now
* Telehealth
* Some are crap, some are based on good information
* CRUfAD is good (based out of St Vincents)
* Different modalities have different **degrees of support** and **intensity**
  * Some entirely self-directed (e.g. checkups, answer questions)
  * One on one is more intense than group.
* **Stepped care**: start with low intensity intervention, then move to more intense if the situation requires it
  * For anxiety/depression could start with psychoeducation, then self-help books, then face-to-face treatment and pharmacotheraphy



## Transcripts

### Lecture 1

When I was little I used to fall over a lot. My sister used to come over, take a look at my grazed knees and spray her magic water on it and I’d feel all better. So, what was this cure that she had given me? Water. Plain water in a spray bottle.

Now, as adorable as this story is, if our medical and mental health system functioned in a similar way, we probably wouldn’t be very pleased. Thankfully, two fundamental concepts at the heart of Australia’s medical and mental health system help to ensure that registered practitioners are held to a high standard and the treatments that they deliver and prescribe have actually been shown to be effective in treating the condition that we have.

Today, we’re going to unpack those two ideas a bit as we take a closer look at the scientist-practitioner model and evidence-based treatment.



The scientist-practitioner model involves the integration of the scientific method with clinical practice. This means that the practitioner actually adopts scientific methods in their general approach with clients. So, for example a psychologist would see a new client, they would use scientifically validated methods in their assessment. The psychologist would formulate a range of hypotheses regarding diagnoses, the factors that are likely maintaining the disorder, and then, based on all this, they would look at the treatment options that the evidence suggests would be most effective in treating the person’s symptoms. Just like we do in science, the psychologist then collects data to evaluate their hypotheses. So, this could be a change in the person’s symptoms before and after the intervention.



Evidence-Based Practice is a related concept that I hinted at just a moment ago. This is where the practitioner selects scientifically validated methods for both the assessment of their clients and also for treatment.

Examples of scientifically validated assessment techniques include evidence-based interviews, where the psychologist asks specific questions in a specific way, or by using tools such as validated questionnaires. Again, these validated questionnaires ask their questions in a very specific way.

The reason that questionnaires and interviews need to be done in a particular way is because the way that questions are asked has an enormous impact on the response that is given. Psychologists need to ensure that the responses that they’re obtaining actually reflect the lived-experience of their client.

The toddler challenge that you may have seen on social media is a great demonstration of how the social environment and the way that questions are asked can influence a person’s response. You’ve probably seen footage of the toddlers sneakily eating the treats while their parent is out of sight but when the parent returns and asks, “Now, you didn’t eat any of the treats did you? I told you not to eat those treats,” lots of the kids shook their heads and said “No, I didn’t eat the treat.” The kids’ responses have been heavily influenced by the way that the question was framed and how that information was delivered. The interviews and questionnaires have been formulated in such a way to minimise these types of bias.

Treatment is usually what comes to mind when we think about evidence-based practice. Regardless of whether it’s the medical or mental health field, the practitioner needs to ensure they’re selecting treatments with best established evidence. This evidence often comes in the form of experiments like Randomised Control Trials and other peer-reviewed studies.



Why is all this important? 

Well, it means that patients are given the best effective treatment possible to help solve their problem. Now, it’s important to acknowledge that the treatment that is the most effective and has the most empirical support may not necessarily be the treatment that is the easiest or the treatment that makes them feel the best in the short term.

Consider a physical issue like breaking a bone. Imagine it’s a really bad break and the two ends of the bone aren’t aligned. Now the treatment that is needed here is actually to set the bone so that it can heal straight. That’s obviously going to be really painful. And in the short term, it might be easier and less painful to leave it be. However, in the long run you probably don’t want to be walking around bone that’s healed crooked. The easier and less painful solution could even cause other problems down the track. So, although the more effective treatment of setting would be harder and more painful in the short term, it would actually be more effective in the long run.

By using evidence-based treatment, the public can be assured that interventions used by registered practitioners are actually effective at making lasting change. They’re not just my sister’s spray-on magic water solution. It may have made me feel better in the moment, but it didn’t actually fix the issue and it didn’t stop the wound getting infected later.



In Australia, the federal body that allocates funding for health and medical research is the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The NHMRC develops and maintains standards for scientific integrity and rigour. They’ve actually got a freely available guide that explains how scientific evidence is used in professional practice. This guide is actually called “How to use the evidence: assessment and application of scientific evidence.”

We’re going to work through a few sections of this resource but I’ll also put up the link to the full resource if you’re interested in finding out more.

So, there are a few different ways that practitioners can assess which treatments have the most support behind them and how good the evidence is for each treatment. In the guide, it lists a number of “Dimensions of evidence” to evaluate.

The guide lists three different dimensions including Strength of evidence, size of effect and relevance of evidence.

- The first dimension, **Strength of evidence**, is broken down into three more sections, these are:
  - **Level:** 	It’s really important to keep in 	mind that *different study designs will 	inherently allow for different levels of bias (*so 	for example a *RCT vs case study – 	we’ll look at this in a minute)*
  - We 	also want to look at the **Quality** of 	the evidence: *how well was this design 	executed and bias controlled for?*
  - **Statistical 	Precision:** This is where scientists 	and practitioners ask *how 	confident can we be in the findings? Are the findings in the study 	likely to reflect the actual state of affairs in the world or did 	this result just come about by chance? What was the “confidence 	interval” (estimated range of effect)? Did estimates range from a 	2-60% reduction in symptoms, or 50-60% reduction?*
- The second dimension is **Size of effect:** This is where the practitioner asks questions like *how much improvement did this treatment cause, did patients show 80% less symptoms or 10% less symptoms?*  
- The third dimension is **Relevance of evidence:** *What outcome measure was used and how relevant is it? Did the study measure broad outcomes e.g. overall symptom reduction, quality of life? Or did the study measure something specific that isn’t relevant to our specific patient e.g. did the intervention improve romantic relationship quality, but our patient is happily single? Or perhaps specific outcomes that are more relevant e.g. days able to attend school/work, days able to engage in social leisure activities/see friends etc.*  



Ok, so let’s go back to the levels of evidence that we spoke about before. Obviously different types of evidence are going to be better than others. Medical and mental health advice from random people of facebook would obviously not be as good as the results of a randomised control trial but where does each type of evidence sit on the NHMRC’s guidelines?

Let’s start at the bottom. A **case series** is a series of case studies. It would look the effects of an intervention in individual patients, usually by measuring their symptom levels before treatment then again after the treatment. 

What might be some problems with this? Take a moment to pause the presentation and write down something that you think could be an issue with this type of evidence.

Hopefully you took this opportunity to write down something. Now, there may be a number of issues with a case series. The issue that stands out most for me is that we don’t have a control group to compare the results to! These people could have just got better on their own, that could really be the natural course of the disease and we wouldn’t know!

Consider the results of a case series on, say, the common cold. You would measure someone’s symptoms when they first get a cold, give them my sister’s magic water spray treatment or something even sillier, like get them to wear a pink tutu for a week! Once the week had gone by, we could measure their symptoms again. You know what? Most likely we’d see a decrease in their symptoms. That doesn’t mean that magic water spray or pink tutus can cure the common cold. There could be any number of factors influencing recovery, from the body’s nature defences to the person resting and getting more sleep etc, we just don’t know. 

So, the next step higher, level 3 is for studies that involve varying degrees of a comparison group. There are three sublevels in level 3. The lowest are the studies with **historical controls.** This is where the results from your current treatment group is compared to the results from another group that you treated at a different point in time, historical data. Now, that’s better than no control at all, but it still leaves open a bunch of factors that could have influenced differences in results like different experimenters interacting with the participants, there may be different participant selection criteria and also biases such as cohort effects.

The next level up from that, you have an experimental and control groups occurring at the same time, in the same experiment but the participants were randomly allocated to those groups. So, maybe you’re looking at a new mental health treatment and you might allow participants to choose whether they want the new treatment or the standard one. In this situation, you have a comparison group but you aren’t randomising so there could be factors relating to the participants and why they chose the different treatments and those factors might influence the data. 

Then the next level up from that is pseudo randomized. This is where you might just alternate people to groups as they walk in the door so group. So, the first person who walks in the door goes into the experimental group and then the next person goes into the control group. Then the next person goes into the experimental group and so on. 

Up on level 2 we have properly designed randomised controlled trials. This is where participants are randomly allocated to groups, there’s a control group, and other variables are controlled as best as possible. This is where experimenters try to keep what we call non-specific treatment characteristics equal. So, say you are comparing two different talking therapies where the client comes into the clinic and has face to face sessions with a therapist. The non-specific characteristics would be how much time the client and therapist spent working together, the warmth and supportiveness of the therapist, as well as other variables like the number of sessions and how many sessions occurred per week.

The highest level of evidence, level 1, is reserved for systematic reviews and meta analyses but only relevant randomised controlled trials are included in the analysis. This ensures that the scientist is comparing like for like experiments. The participants are similar, and the experimental variables are similar too. This prevents obvious issues such as comparing a three-week talking therapy intervention with children to the results of 12-week relationship counselling with elderly couples.



So, how can we as consumers ensure that the therapies that we are offered have actually made the grade? Find out in the next lecture!

### Lecture 2

How do you know if a treatment is backed by science? Well, there are a few different ways you check.

You could do your own literature search. You could look up meta-analyses, systematic reviews and RCTS. And you might find that for each disorder, a number of different treatment options are available and have been tested to verify their therapeutic effect.

Some of the studies will look at different types of treatment, for example, pharmacotherapy vs psychotherapy. Other studies may compare different classes or subtypes within those categories. So, for example a study may compare two different medications, or different talking therapies like CBT vs BA.

More recently, studies have begun to compare different modalities of treatment. This would be where the study compares the effectiveness of individual vs group therapy, or face to face vs over the phone vs online. I expect that we’ll see many more of these types of comparative studies post-covid.

The other type of study that is quite common when looking at the effectiveness of treatment are studies that compare short vs long-term effects. So, studies may record how the person is fairing immediately post-treatment and compare this to various follow-up time points; how is the person six months later? 12 months later? 2 years later? These are important factors that need to be considered.



Now, thankfully, there are a number of reputable organisations who have performed reviewed of the scientific literature for us! Phew!

One such organisation is The Cochrane Collaboration. This is an independent body that forms panels to develop systematic reviews of the strongest evidence available for different healthcare interventions, including for mental disorders. These reviews are very comprehensive and very well respected. More information about The Cochrane Collaboration is available at this address https://www.cochrane.org/about-us

Another great source of reviews is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, commonly called NICE. They are a government body in the UK that supports their National Health Service by conducting reviews and developing evidence-based treatment pathways, again including mental health. 

In Australia, we don’t have a direct equivalent unfortunately, but the Australian Psychological Society did publish a review of evidence-based treatments for mental disorders in 2018. It’s a freely available resource that you can view online here. 

https://www.psychology.org.au/About-Us/What-we-do/advocacy/Position-Papers-Discussion-Papers-and-Reviews/psychological-interventions-mental-disorders

Now, of course these reviews are all done by different people so there will be some disagreement between them, but if you compare different reviews, there should be some consensus about treatments with the best evidence. 

And actually, that’s exactly what three researchers from Spain did in 2017. They took published reviews by a range of organisations including those I’ve spoken about and compared their findings for a range of anxiety disorders and depression.

So, what did they find?



Overall, the two most effective therapies for anxiety disorders were CBT and exposure therapy. CBT was shown to be most effective for GAD, panic and social anxiety whereas exposure therapy was most effective for specific phobias.

For depression the picture was a bit different. There were a range of therapies that had some level of support including Behavioural Activation, CBT, interpersonal therapy, problem solving therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and couples therapy. However, whilst all of these therapies have varying degrees of support the gold-standard therapies for depression across a variety of different sources are CBT, BA and IPT.

Now, we’ve spoken a lot about CBT in this course but what exactly is CBT? Well, CBT is a type of talking therapy that systematically targets the maintaining factors identified in models of disorders. So, remember how we spoke about the stimuli, cognitions, physiology and behaviours that keep the disorder going? Well, CBT addresses each of these factors in a very particular way.

There are three main stages to CBT. In Stage 1, the therapist assesses the client, makes their diagnosis. The therapist also gives the client what’s known as **psycheducation**. This is where the therapist teaches the person about what is going on with their disorder including those maintaining factors that they will worked on in the therapy itself. The final part of Stage 1 is where the therapist formulates the individual’s case and takes into consideration all the nuances and idiosyncrasies that are unique to that person. So, although CBT is a very particular and structured method of therapy, it’s not just an out of the box, one size fits all approach. It is tailored to the specific needs of each person.



Stage 2 is what most people would intuitively recognise as therapy. As the name suggests, cognitive-behavioural therapy targets both the cognitive and behavioural components that maintain the disorder. As a result of this, the physiological components of their emotions are changed too. So, although CBT isn’t itself a biological intervention, it still affects the person’s biology. Pretty neat, huh?

The cognitive interventions used in CBT are varied and can involve things like challenging unhelpful appraisals and helping people shift their perspective on some things that are keeping the disorder going. As we saw in the cognitive model of depression, these were important maintaining factors, and so by challenging these dysfunctional appraisals it helps to break down one of core aspects maintaining the disorder.

The other two aspects of CBT that we’re going to look at relate to behaviours. Remember last week when we spoke about the behavioural activation model, we noted that avoidance plays a really important part in maintaining depression. This is because when the person avoids challenging situations, they never getting the opportunity to learn that those situations aren’t actually as bad as they imagined. So, part of the **behavioural intervention** could be exposure so that the frequency of those avoidance behaviours can reduce. Remember that this is due to extinction learning. What may happen alongside this is that the avoidance behaviours can then get replaced with alternative behaviours and these new behaviours may even lead to functional reinforcement!

The final part of CBT involves what’s known as **behvioural experiments**. This is where the person can challenge their cognitive appraisals on their own by actually putting themselves in the situation that they’ve been avoiding. Now, as opposed to exposure which works on the principles of extinction learning, in a behavioural experiment the person goes into the situation with a clear hypothesis they’re going to test.



You may have experienced something similar yourself. Have you ever put off doing something because you imagined that it was going to be totally horrible but then, when you actually got out there and did it, it really wasn’t as bad as you thought it was going to be?

Well, behavioural experiments are similar. The client and therapist develop a hypothesis related to the person’s faulty appraisal and then the client goes out and tests that hypothesis. By challenging their inaccurate evaluations and collecting first-hand evidence that their appraisals are not an accurate reflection of the world, this helps the person to change their thinking habits. Beck and Clark would say that the person is changing their schemas!

The final stage involves relapse prevention. This involves a number of strategies like identifying factors that might put people at risk of going back to those inaccurate and dysfunctional thought patterns or re-adopting those avoidance behaviours. The therapist and client might discuss some early warning signs that the person can look out for so that, if relapse does start to happen, the person can react appropriately to manage that situation.



Now, we mentioned before that there are different modalities of psychological therapy, it’s not all just face to face. We’ve seen a massive increase in these alternate modalities in the past decade and now again with COVID. One of the most common modalities at the moment is **telehealth.** This is where clinicians conduct the consultations either over the phone, via a webchat or via video calls. 

Now, it’s worth noting that these reviews have all focused on one modality of therapy, what you stereotypically think of as therapy, so face to face and on—on-one therapy with a psychologist. However, over the last decade the world has well and truly changed, and we’ve seen some big shifts in the way that therapy is conducted. Therapy isn’t always face to face with a psychologist. We’ve seen the introduction of internet-based therapies so things like apps and web-based modules or workbooks. Now, some of the things out there have no evidence whatsoever, but some are actually based on quality CBT strategies and have even been tested in RCTs. One organization that’s doing this really well is the Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression which is based out of St Vincent’s hospital. They focus on anxiety and depression and take the best evidence-based therapies, adapt them for online modules, test the effectiveness of these online modules in RCTs, and then make these modules available for people to complete, usually at a small fee. If you’d like to take a look at CRUfAD and the type of work that they do you can find them at this URL. https://crufad.org/



Now, across all of these different modalities, there can be varying **Degrees of support** and also the **intensity** of the therapy. So, if we use internet-based therapy as an example, one therapy might be completely self-directed. The client signs up to the program of their own accord and engages with the therapy materials all on their own without any outside support. A variation on this might be a situation where GP initially prescribes the internet-based course but then the therapy is self-directed, similar to the last situation. Some internet-based therapies are **therapist-supported**. This is where a qualified therapist will follow-up and check-in with the client at various time points to see how they’re doing, provide support and motivation and answer any questions that may have popped up during the therapy process. The take home message is that the modality of treatment can look very different depending on the type and severity of the disorder being treated and other factors like if the patient lives in a rural or remote area etc. 

The other thing to consider is the **intensity** of the therapy. If we use face-to-face therapies as an example, one-on-one therapy is more intensive than group therapy, partly because all of the therapist’s time and focus is directed to one person, rather than being distributed amongst a group of people.



These two concepts of degrees of support and intensity of therapy are cornerstones of a relatively new model of health care called **stepped-care**. This is the idea that for some disorders you start with low intensity interventions in the first instance and only move to more intense therapies if the situation warrants it. So, for instance if certain disorder features are present or if the severity is severe then the therapist would move to or even start at a higher step of support and intensity.

For disorders like anxiety and depression, stepped care could be initial psychoeducation. Remember that this is giving information about the disorder, what causes it, what keeps it going. And then there might be internet modules or self-help workbooks, and then if the patient hasn’t adequately improved, they might be escalated to face to face treatment and in some cases, pharmacotherapy might be considered.

The stepped-care movement really originated in the UK where the IAPT program was introduced, the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies program, and this was quite radical, it was a complete overhaul of the mental health model over there and they developed whole new professions requiring new training and regulation to implement some of the less intense levels of the interventions, for example they created CBT therapists over there.

Now I realise that this is Australia not the UK, but the success of the program over there has created a push for it here in Australia, and some primary health networks, which are like little regions of the healthcare system, they’re encouraging the adoption of this type of model and have created contracts to providers for lower intensity interventions in some areas. 

Thanks for watching!

Today we looked at evidence-based treatment, what this term means and how to find out if a treatment is backed by scientific evidence. We also had a look at the different levels of evidence that different treatments can have from a single case study or series of case studies right up to careful systematic meta-analyses of randomised control trials, like those run by the Cochrane Collaboration. We looked at CBT, different modalities and intensities of therapy and finished off with an overview of the stepped-care model.

In our final week together, we’re going to get the low down on stress. What is it? Why do we feel it? And, most importantly for exam time, what are some things we can do to manage it?
