## Reasoning

Descriptive: is

Prescriptive (normative): ought

David Hume -> Hume's Law



Utilitarianism (prescriptive) = Empirical (descriptive)



### Utilitarianism

founded on a hedonist conception of values

* Happiness/pleasure

* Suffering/pain

either maximise happiness or minimise suffering

pleasure and pain are much more quantifiable, how do you measure other emotions: courage, temperance, justice in a very simple system



### Consequentialism

focuses on consequences



#### Consequentialism is the genus, utilitarianism is the species



If our focus is on the consequences/outcomes, what if horrible actions create great outcomes

* acts don't have a consequence value, only outcomes do
* e.g. [Romulus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism-rule/) (idealistic utopia, but one child is tortured daily to maintain it)
* All entities are impartially equal (not just humans)
