assumed 20% risk of drug experimentation leading to dependence (estimated 13.4%)

7 times higher probability of use if you have a drug-using sibling

increased risk if within 0-4 years



expectencies

​	may explain strong intergenerational transfer of addictive behaviour

​	argued all risk factors increase positive drug expentencies, and lower negative ones



Drug liking

burden of disease metrics (46)



instrumental/operant conditioning

​	law of effect

​	skinner box

​	fixed/variable interval/ratio schedule



action potential

​	sodium channels open (fire)



synaptic cleft: gap between terminal button and dendrite of neighbouring cell

​	this is where drugs act to create addiction



reuptake: sending neuron reabosrbs excess neurotransmitters



primary receptor << of cocaine is dopamine



neurotransmitters open ion channels



agonists fit a receptor perfectly and open/close linked cell

antagonists fit imperfectly, and block the neurotransmitter



effective dose



olds and milner rats dopamine reward



mdma is a serotonin agonist



hedonistic reactions procedure (pleasant/unpleasant), bitter/sweet solution squirted



nicotine addictive potential



gaba reduces the probability of an action potential



GLutamate is the most abudant neurotransmitter in the brain



desensitization ddown regulations protect from super optimal receptor binding from drug exposure



decreased gaba -> less inhibition

increased glutamate -> increased excitation



crash withdrawal extinction (stimulant withdrawal)



abstinence withdrawal relapse



condition withdrawal

​	negative reinforcement to remove withdrawal symptons

​	positive reinforcement from feelings of drug



conditioned tolerance

​	opponent process model

​	homeostasis



matching law choices are allocated between two options in accordance with relative frequency of rewards
